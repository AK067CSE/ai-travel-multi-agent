The sub is one of the biggest on Reddit and as a community it's so important - particularly for a topic like travel which is rooted in authentic human experiences - that all responses come in the form of genuine opinions and guidance. There's absolutely no point in us all being on here otherwise. Mods have tools to identify these sort of posts, but it's worth reiterating moving into 2025 and with increased AI available in our day-to-day lives that any usage of this sort to make your posts or comments will result in an instant ban. The rules are stated very clearly in the sidebar and are not new. None of us joined this community to read regurgitated information from a machine learning model like ChatGPT. AI tools can have their place for travellers sometimes, but outside of the occasional spellcheck or minor translation it should never be the main foundational element for any of your posts on this sub. We want responses to be *your* opinions and knowledge. If you're asking a question, we want it to be in *your* voice. If you suspect any usage we haven't spotted, report it - we are a group of volunteers on a huge sub and things often slip through the net. I'm sure all users are on the same page here in terms of not letting AI generated content take over here, so it requires us all to work together.

Cape Town has a spectacular natural setting for a city, but it's also an architectural treasure trove. Every building on Long Street is gorgeous, as is Bo-Kaap. The coastal suburbs around Cape Town have great beaches, with the Twelve Apostles mountain range towering over them.

We booked the flight for 3rd of September and 17th of September back. Our current plan is to be some days in chicago then travel to detroit via greyhound bus. We would stay a night in detroit, cross the border to Windsor, stay a night in Windsor and then travel to Toronto/Niagara Falls with the canadian VIA rail. From there we would rent a car and continue our journey to NYC on the streets. The problem is that we somehow have to cross the Detroit River. I first considered the tunnel bus but I just noticed that this service will be no more after the 31st of August. There is also this Ambassador Bridge, which is only allowed to pass by car and as we wont have a car at that time this isnt an option too. Then there is the Gordie Howe Bridge which would have a lane for pedestrians but is still currently under construction. Construction should end in september, but there is no date of opening known so I guess it wont be open until we are visiting. At least there is a flixbus connection between Detroit and Windsor, which is just a little more expensive than the old tunnelbus. Still the bus needs 40 minutes and I am not sure why it needs so long. Does the Tunnelbus also need this long? Is it because the flixbus drives via Ambassador Bridge? Me as an european I am left a little bit stunned that there is really no other way than the flixbus. So Im asking if I am missing something out or how are commuters doing it? I also thought about renting a car directly in Chicago or Detroit and travel just by car but I am not really a fan of it. On the one hand I try to plan the trip as sustainable as practically possible, on the other hand renting a car is pretty expensive as I am considered as a young driver and Im also not a fan of driving all of the around 1000 mi by myself.

They had pre-booked wheelchair assistance due to mobility issues and age-related limitations. After checking in, they were taken by electric cart to a transit room where they waited for nearly an hour. When it was time to go to the gate, the cart driver refused to take them further and told them they had to walk a certain distance, and someone else would assist from there. That \"someone\" never arrived. My father requested to be taken back to the assistance desk, where two staff members were reportedly indifferent and unhelpful. Despite Emirates staff eventually arriving to say the flight was closing, the airport team still didn’t act. There were no wheelchairs in sight, and my father had to push my mother in a wheelchair himself — at their age, this was both distressing and physically demanding. This was not a minor inconvenience. It was a serious, especially for passengers who rely on the special assistance service. My father had a recent stroke in Jan 2025 and recovered and walks with support. After we submitted a formal complaint, Emirates offered 15,000 Skywards Miles per passenger as a goodwill gesture. While we appreciate the acknowledgment, the miles barely amount to anything meaningful. We’ve asked Emirates to consider providing complimentary tickets for a future trip on the same sector as a more appropriate form of compensation. What do you think — is this a fair request? Has anyone else had to escalate something similar with Emirates or airport assistance services?

I just found this sub and thought it might be a good place to post an airport experience I had. This was back in December of 2019. I am a US citizen, and was traveling from the US to Thailand. I had connecting flights in Nanjing, China, then to Kunming, China, before we flew to Thailand. Once we got into Kunming, we had a 13 hour layover from 6pm-7am the next day… yes… I know… we booked the cheapest flight. I’ve never met any other US citizens who have traveled through the Kunming Changshui International Airport, so am curious to hear from others about their experience! Some things that occurred: - Any of the few restaurants the airport had were closed by 8pm it seemed. Not that strange but we should have done research sooner. - We went to the bottom floor of the airport that had a bunch of chairs connected into benches, and laid down so we could get some sleep. We woke up to the airport security rolling through on segways waking everyone up who was doing the same as us, and yelling at them. I’m assuming they were saying they can’t sleep there.. so we got up before they got around to us. - Once midnight rolled around, the airport seemed entirely empty on the main floors. Literally saw maybe 1 or 2 other people. We were just walking around because we clearly couldn’t sleep in the chairs. - We found some sleeping pods, but immediately noticed they were labeled “No Foreigners”. - When about 5am hit, we noticed a fast food place had lights on. We went to try and buy food, and the workers seemed confused. We pulled out our credit cards and pointed to the menu, and they crossed their hands in a “no” signal, and backed away and walked back into the kitchen. We ended up sleeping for an hour or 2 sitting upright in some chairs, didn’t get any food, and caught our flight to Thailand. I wouldn’t call this a “terrible” experience, because I find the odds and ends of traveling exciting, and have traveled internationally quite a few times. I would call this more, confusing? Especially the experience with the workers at the open fast food restaurant. Just curious if anyone has had any similar experiences! Thanks!

Me and my partner are finalizing the plans for our much needed vacation in Scotland at the end of July and as a long time member of this community, I always love seeing peoples itineraries and reading all the helpful comments and wonderful recommendations from locals or more seasoned travelers. Now I would appreciate to have my own itinerary reviewed. The key words for this trip are: quaint towns, old pubs, hiking, scenic road trips, castles * Day 1: landing at EDI, picking up the rental car and driving to Sterling. We want to walk around, grab a bite, have some whisky, enjoy ourselves. * Day 2: drive to Glencoe, staying the night. If there’s anything interesting to visit on the way from Sterling to Glencoe, we want to stop there (preferably a castle - Invereray maybe?), but if not we will leave for Glencoe right after breakfast and do dome hiking there (we are both experienced hikers). * Day 3: doing a longer hike in Glencoe, then we leave for Isle of Skye. Skye will be all about the nature, most likely Fairy pools and Old man of Storr. We want to find somewhere to swim. It seems very challenging to find an affordable accommodation on Isle of Skye right now. Are there any sites where we could book some very simple B&B at somebody’s house or farm? I’ve looked everywhere but was unsuccessful. * Day 4. Depending on if we find a good accommodation, we would spend one more night at Skye. If not, we will drive to Inverness, explore, spend the night. * Day 5: we didn’t plan anything here, I’m still researching what to add here. We will be making our way back south. * Day 6: Castle Bamburg and Lindisfarne. We drive to Edinburg at the end of the day to spend the night there. We will also return the rental car. * Day 7: Edinburgh. We want to explore the city and just wrap up the trip nicely :) Our flight home is on the next day at 6am.

Our first night was booked for the 10th of July. Our flight landed at 1:00am on the 11th, and to avoid being stranded without accommodation upon arrival, we intentionally booked the night of the 10th. While making the reservation, Booking.com provided an option to request a late check-in between 1:00am and 2:00am, which we selected and proceeded to pay for. Unfortunately, when we arrived, we were unable to check in and were left without a place to stay. As a result, we had to book a last-minute room at the airport hotel. While the original accommodation did allow check-in the following day, we essentially lost one night’s payment and incurred an additional cost for the unexpected hotel stay. I contacted Booking.com to report the issue and was initially told by the first customer service representative (I have an audio recording of the call) that I would be reimbursed for the extra night if I provided the invoice from the airport hotel. However, when I called back a few hours later to ask where to send the invoice, the second representative stated that a reimbursement would not be possible.

{"id": "cbc8960721c6abccf812f594e3e66042", "prompt": "First solo trip this October – 5 weeks in Spain on a £2k budget. Itinerary + any advice welcome", "response": "Hey all, I’m heading out on my first ever solo trip this October. I’m 23, from the UK, and will be spending about 5 weeks travelling through Spain with a budget of around £2000 (~€2300), not including flights. I’ve done Barcelona and Madrid before, so this time I’m focusing mostly on the south and coast. I was originally planning to do South to North but am concerned about weather + how lively the North will be (outside of hubs like Bilbao). Spain feels like the right balance for a first solo trip — culturally rich, affordable, and relatively easy, but still with plenty going on. I also speak confident conversational Spanish. What I’m aiming for: -A mix of cities, beach towns, and a bit of nature -Local food, walkable areas, and a few museums or cultural spots -Social hostels (not party-heavy, just good for meeting people) -Hoping to try surfing once — somewhere chill and beginner-friendly -A pace that gives me enough variety without feeling rushed First draft Itinerary: Málaga – 3 nights Granada – 4 nights Ronda – 1 night (scenic stop en route to Cádiz) Cádiz – 4 nights (possible day trip to Vejer de la Frontera) Tarifa – 4–5 nights (surf town, chill beach vibe) Seville – 4 nights Valencia – 5–6 nights Madrid – 1 night (just for flight home) Budget: I’ve got around £2000 for everything on the ground — accommodation, food, transport, activities, etc. I’ll mostly stay in hostels, mostly eat local (menu del día + supermarkets), and keep travel overland via bus/train. Would appreciate any thoughts on pacing or tips for October — especially whether small towns like Ronda or Vejer are worth an overnight or better as day trips. Also open to hostel or surf school recommendations. Thanks!", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

This trip was a personal step forward—an attempt to live a little more independently, get stronger physically, and grow more confident navigating a new country on my own. About the Trip My goal was to build stamina and reconnect with nature. I did this through garden hopping, walking Singapore’s urban parks, and hiking nature trails like Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Bukit Timah Hill. I also allowed time for fun and discovery—including the thrill of Universal Studios Singapore. Itinerary Day 1 – Bugis & Pasir Ris Got my bearings by shopping at Bugis and learning how to use the MRT and bus system. Later, I walked around Pasir Ris Park, which was calm and quiet—a nice way to settle in. Day 2 – Fort Canning, Bayfront & Chinatown Mixed light hiking with sightseeing. Fort Canning’s steps gave me a nice burn, then I walked from Bayfront to Chinatown for local eats and quick shopping. The evening views of the city were beautiful. Day 3 – Universal Studios Singapore (USS) Thrill day! I went all in—rides, shows, and everything in between. The Mummy coaster and Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure were highlights. It was tiring but so worth it. Day 4 – Bukit Timah Nature Reserve This was the most physically challenging trail. Steep, humid, and rocky, but the sense of accomplishment when reaching the summit made it one of my favorite experiences. Brought water, went slow, and took breaks when needed. Day 5 – Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve + Nearby Trails Peaceful and scenic. I spotted wildlife like monitor lizards and herons while walking through wooden boardwalks surrounded by mangroves. Also visited Kranji Marshes for a final stretch and fresh air. What Went Well I learned more about my physical limits and improved my confidence in solo travel. I loved being able to take things at my own pace, stay outdoors, and navigate unfamiliar places on my own. I walked a lot, felt proud of myself for pushing through hikes, and genuinelyenjoyedm seeing myself be able to conquer this. What Didn’t Go Well By Day 3, my lower back felt sore, likely from walking with a crossbody bag for too long. I thought of getting a massage, but most were too pricey for my budget. I managed with light stretching and rest in the evenings. ⚠️ Safety as a Solo Female Traveler While Singapore is one of the safest countries I’ve visited with family, I had a moment that made me uncomfortable. A man (an Indian stranger I didn’t know) kept asking for my number and was persistent even when I clearly said no. It didn’t escalate, but it reminded me that being cautious is still necessary—even in “safe” places. I trusted my gut so I lied a that I have some acquaintances at my hotel so I won't just be forced to get drinks.", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

I am 34(w) and traveled for 21 days in Japan. My itinerary was 1 night in Tokyo 3 nights in Kyoto 2 nights in Hiroshima 5 nights in Fukuoka 5 nights on Ishigaki 5 nights in Tokyo I just wanted to share how amazing this experience was. I have seen so many beautiful temples, waterfalls, beaches and met wonderful people and friends. I get why Japan is so popular. The best experiences I had where in the more remote places though. The locals where really helpful and friendly. I was Nokonoshima while it was raining (went in June to Japan during rainy season). I forgot my umbrella and was just walking the road. One old man drove by and saw me walking alone in the rain. A minute later he drove back and gave me an umbrella. He smiled and said in a Japanese accent „present“ and left. This one little act of kindness was so unexpected, but it was so meaningful to me. In general I still can’t fathom the fact, that I traveled to the other side of the world alone. I did it on my own. And I didn’t „survived“ I thrived! I went so much out of my comfort zone. By that I don’t mean adventures, like first time scubadiving. I forced myself to talk to people. Even tho I was scared, I was brave and talked to other solotravelers. And it was amazing. The connections I made, even if I suffer from social anxiety. I could never have thought that that would happen. I feel like this journey changed me so profoundly. I can only try to explain it. I just wanted to share my sentiment today, I hope that’s ok.

Been feeling the urge to play this game again after a recent trip, so...... Figured best way to start orf is say hello with a trip report. Started in oaxaca, ended in cdmx. I travel slooooow, colectivos and most verily low cla55 buses. Oaxaca - San Jose del Pacifico - Puerto Angel - Mazunte - PE/LP - Oaxaca - Tuxtepec - Veracruz - Xalapa - Papantla - Cordoba - Puebla - Cuetzalan - Tlapacoyan - Puebla - Cuautla - Tepoztlan - Tlayacapan - Cuernavaca - CDMX - Tula - CDMX - Malinalco - CDMX Carried a lonely planet, its compulsion. Used the last edition, as the newest version is inferior... Was on the fence about carrying it, as i roll with a personal size bag, glad i did, It pointed to some great places. Sure, having a phone has changed solo travel, but having a book did help. The ADO app is pretty slick, used it to research routes and times, but actually taking an ADO, meh, never. Overpriced (though deals can be found if booking week+ in advance) and plenty of other operators, especially on the regional routes. There is also the **ahorrobus** app, which works in the region connecting smaller towns. You charge a card and swipe when you get on the bus, these busses can generally be flagged down. Always check when the busses leave to your next destination when you arrive, ask if you should buy in advance, then you know. **Take a picture of the posted timetables**. Traveler 101 right there. The metro in cdmx is oarsome. learn it, use it, explore it. Stayed in local hotels, the more style and personal touches the better. What i consider nice, private rooms with bath, usually near town center, and always springing for a balcony if available. **Averaged about $27 a night,** not counting CDMX. Stayed in a few hostels, as that is how it should be done... But the days of staying in dorms, volunteering, and throwing epic theme parties are behind me. Met some great peeps at em.... It made me smile to see backpacker culture still alive and well, if not stronger than ever in some ways. **Never really made reservations**, cept a few on hostelworld, and in cdmx, but for the most part used google maps and that bookingdotcom app for reviews to find places, walked up and got a room. Looked for places that have personal style, owned by a family, with good enough reviews. Always ask to see the room, dont be afraid to walk and find something else if you dont feel it. If you dont mind stairs **ask for the top floor**, the room will always have less wear and tear, more privacy, hopefully a view, and it opens the door to negotiate. If staying more than 2 nights, always try to get a few pesos orf, especially during the week and orf season. Explored 15 ruin sites along the way... The highlights were **Cantona**, **El Cuajilote**, and **Xochicalco**. The **Ruta Zapata** is a most excellent day of not so distant history and colectivo hoping from town to town starting in Cuaulta. North of Cuaulta is Tlayacapan, with its many chapels and hike up to the ruins of **El Tlatoani**, with amazing views of the valley. One of my fave museums in the americas turned out to be the **Museo de Arte Prehispánico de México Rufino Tamayo** in oaxaca. Soooo much art, displayed and explained chronologically as art. You can see the styles evolve over 100s of years. Papantlas lively zocalo was an unexpected highlight as an entry point for **El Tajin**. Security said i **kant wear a belt** to a Club America game, and took it. Prepare accordingly. Some simple spanish words/phrases and knowing a few hand gestures will help tremendously in these parts, as there is just not that much english spoken. Great if you are looking to improve your language skillz. No matter where you are going, or your spanish skill level, take the time to **learn some hand gestures.** **I**ts part of speaking mexican, it shows you are putting in the effort, which can lead to things you never expected. Anyway, blah... blah.... blah... Thats enough. Central Mexico is amazing. Mexicans are rightly proud of their cultural heritage, and when a solo gringo wanders into town to check the local ruins nobody visits, they for the most part just wanna help. If you are thinking of getting a bit orf the usual tourist route in mexico, the middle has tons to offer. If anyone has any questions about these places, i might have answers.

{"id": "cd3ddf147271980c38569af4cd2cab36", "prompt": "Trip report: Malaysia (Tioman, Perhentians, CH, TN, KL)", "response": "**TL;DR: I try to provide some up-to-date first-hand information and tips that I couldn't find online when planning the itinerary. Hopefully it is helpful to people planning to visit Malaysia beyond KL.** I had 2 weeks to spend solo in Malaysia in the first half of **July** (so high season) after staying in Singapore for work reasons. I decided to avoid flying to reduce costs (looking back at it now, I am not sure it was the best decision) and that is the reason my itinerary turned to be like this. I was interested in the natural part of Malaysia more than the urban one, so most of the time was spent on islands or hiking/trekking the jungles. While it is easy to find travel information for places like KL or Penang online, I had trouble getting answers to all my questions regarding other destinations when trying to arrange the transportation between them and stuff like that (even asking on subreddits like [r/Malaysia](https://www.reddit.com/r/Malaysia/) didn't help much). Sometimes the information online was just old and outdated. So this post will be something I wish I could read when planning my trip. First, on the **intercity transportation**: I used coaches (buses) to get around Malaysia with one exception, when I took an overnight train from Johor Bahru to Kota Bharu (more on that later). For the buses, I used the apps **BusOnlineTicket**, **Easybook** and **redBus** (each at least once, as they have some generous new-customer discounts). I had never had issues with any of the apps, but there are some stories online about difficulty getting a refund when the bus is cancelled or whatever reason, so be careful (I never encountered a cancelled bus, though). It is perfectly fine to not book in advance, as I always saw free seats up to 1 day before the ride (and this was high season, note). On some bus terminals (Johor Bahru, Ipoh), you are required to \"convert\" the ticket purchased online into a QR code (which is necessary to get through the gate) and it costs 2-3 RM. In that case, allocate extra 5-10min because there may be queues to the ticket counter. **Alternatively**, these apps provide the option to do it online (which still costs extra, but at least you don't have to wait in queues). The buses may depart with a delay, but overall the situation was much better than expected: my worst experience was \"just\" 30min late. Usually, this delay is compensated with how fast the bus drivers are driving (Asia...). The seats in the buses are comfortable and much more spacious than in European Flixbus (for those who know). Now, for the Johor Bahru - Kota Bharu train. This is the so-called East Coast railway line, one of the two Malaysia has. The trains are not very frequent on this line, so I highly advise to book in advance (I booked a month before the trip, and a quarter of the sleeper bunks had already been taken). The station in Johor Bahru is located right after the immigration, and after you have found it, it's pretty clear what to do. The sleeper carriage is pretty basic, you get a bunk (with curtains for privacy), a pillow and a blanket (very thin, and it does get cold at night), a small window and a light (mine was broken). I was not confident enough to leave my luggage outside the bunk, but most people were keeping it in the corridor without any issues. The bathroom was also very basic to say the least, but at least there was water and paper towels. My train arrived 45min late, which almost led to a missed ferry, so allocate a time buffer just in case. As a side note: to get to Kota Bharu, the closest station is Wakaf Bharu, and then a Grab from there for 8 RM (allegedly, there is a bus, but I didn't have time to verify that). OK, let's do this chronologically now. **Johor Bahru:** As I mentioned, I started in Singapore and crossed the border to Johor Bahru in Woodlands. There are many options to cross Woodlands (the most comfortable, arguably, is the train shuttle, which you have to book long in advance, however). I took a **Causeway Link** bus from the centre of Singapore (Queen Street), which they call **CW2** (this was around 10-11am, for context). It takes you straight to Singapore immigration in Woodlands. You then have to get off and proceed to immigration on foot. The immigration is fully automatic and quick (thanks, Singapore), only took me 10min in total, including the time I spent trying to generate a QR code which is required to exit Singapore in Woodlands (I'm still not sure if it is really necessary, though). You then board the bus again (any bus, it doesn't have to be the same one. There were several buses waiting outside) which takes you over the bridge (which they call Causeway) straight to the Malaysian immigration. This causeway is notorious for taking a long time to cross in peak times, but thankfully the journey lasted maybe 15min in my case. The Malaysian immigration took longer than Singaporean (up to 1 hour waiting in the queue), but still bearable. On making it through, you just follow the people which takes you to the Johor Bahru railway station (on the upper floor), the bus station (on the bottom floor), and the JB City Square mall a bit further on. This mall is where you I advise to take out cash, they have ATMs from many reputable banks (e.g. Maybank, UOB etc.). Cash is necessary in Malaysia once you leave big cities. Some merchants on the islands or in Taman Negara might have a card terminal, but that is rare and I would not rely on that. Interstate buses from Johor Bahru usually depart from **Larkin** terminal, which is further away from the railway station. To get to Larkin, you can either board the aforementioned CW buses or the local myBAS buses **T10/T13** from the **JB Sentral** bus terminal (under the railway station). On CW buses you can tap-to-pay; in theory, you should be able to do the same on myBAS, but their card terminals never worked when I tried, so be prepared with cash (no more than 2-3 RM). Once in Larkin, if you have booked your coach ticket online, you must go to the ticket counter to \"convert\" it into a QR code which costs you extra 2 RM (tap-to-pay possible) **or** do this in the app in which you booked the ticket (if possible). **Tioman:** the most convenient way to get to the island, is to board a ferry in **Mersing**, a small coastline town. It is well connected with Johor Bahru. There are 2 spots you should be interested in: the *jetty* (where you board a ferry) and the *Mersing harbour centre* (where you buy the tickets and pay the conservation fee). They lie on the opposite sides of the road. You can either buy tickets online or at the ticket counter (and I have seen people buying the ticket at the ticket counter on the departure day, so apparently it is possible to not book in advance - I would not advise it, though). There are 2 ferry operators - **Bluewater** and **Cataferry**. I managed to try both - Cataferry on my way to Tioman and Bluewater on my way back. It is undeniable that Cataferry is superior in terms of comfort, but their ferries are less frequent and usually more expensive (*however,* when I was booking online, the price was almost 50% less than Bluewater for a one-way ticket, so I bought it without a second thought). For Bluewater, it is impossible to buy one-way tickets online, so to obtain a ticket back from Tioman, I had to go to the ticket counters in the Mersing harbour centre. When buying a ticket there, be sure to verify all the details (day, time, jetty etc.) with the lady at the counter: she misunderstood me and sold me a ticket **to** Tioman, instead of **from**. It turns out, they cannot change or cancel the ticket in their system. It was a miracle, that I was immediately able to resell the ticket to some friendly British family waiting behind me in the queue. In any case, you have to arrive at the Mersing harbour centre before your ferry and pay the conservation fee RM 30 (not sure if someone actually checks it, but still). If your ticket is online from Cataferry, you then go to the jetty, join the (proper) queue and wait for boarding (prepare your passport and the ticket). If your ticket is online from Bluewater, you apparently have to exchange it for a physical ticket at the counter (what they call \"check-in\") before joining the queue (this was not my case, so I cannot 100% confirm it). Note that Cataferry tickets have assigned seats, while Bluewater ones do not. On Tioman, I was staying at Air Batang village (ABC). It has a jetty, but Cataferry doesn't stop there (at least, not always). It stops in Tekek village, which is where I got off and took a lovely 1-hour walk from there to Tekek (not the best idea if you have a lot of luggage). To be clear, there is a road connecting ABC with Tekek - it is not suitable for cars, but can be (and is) used by motorcycles and pedestrians. Be prepared for insects inside your room, it is hardly possible to avoid them in such an environment. There are multiple operators for snorkeling, but the prices and offers are literally the same: the most reasonable and popular trip, which takes you through 5 spots, costs 100 RM and takes 5 hours. There is no point in booking in advance, there should always be spots for walk-in. In my case, the equipment was also included in the price (life vest, fins, snorkel and mask). It was my first time doing snorkeling, so for the people in the same position, the process looks like this: you board a small (max 12 person) boat and set off; the boat driver stops in a few spots and gives everyone some time to snorkel around and see some sealife; around the middle of the trip there is a lunch break, so take cash with you. Note that the inside of the boat gets super wet very quickly, so a waterproof bag is highly recommended. When it comes to the sealife, there was a lot of corals and colorful fishes, we saw dolphins in the distance and some people saw a turtle. For the ferry back, I just had to arrive at the jetty in advance with a ticket and wait. Note that some Bluewater ferries don't even have \"Bluewater\" written on them anywhere, so it might be confusing. But if there are many people boarding it, and \"Cataferry\" is not written on the ferry, then it must be a Bluewater ferry. After arriving back at Mersing, my plan was to return to Johor Bahru and board the train to Kota Bharu. I did not book the bus from Mersing to Johor Bahru because it was impossible to predict if the ferry will arrive on time. Unfortunately, once it did arrive, in the app the bus was already all booked up. However, when I approached the driver, it turned out that there are 2 empty seats, so I managed to get on that bus by paying directly to the driver (it was even a little bit cheaper). **Perhentians:** as I mentioned before, the train from Johor Bahru took me to **Wakaf Bharu**, and arrived 45min late. Wakaf Bharu is a satellite town of the big city of **Kota Bharu**. There are a lot of ferries to Perhentian islands, and most of them (if not all) depart from **Kuala Besut** (a small coastal town). In order to get from Kota Bharu to Kuala Besut, you can either get a Grab (very expensive), a shared van (they require min 2 person per online booking), or a local bus **#639** (costs around 7 RM and takes 1.5-2 hours). The last option is what I settled for. First, I took a Grab from Wakaf Bharu to Kota Bharu bus terminal (be careful, because Kota Bharu has 2 bus terminals: one for short-distance buses in the city centre, and one for long-distance buses a bit to the south). The bus #639 departs from the bus terminal every 2 hours or so, so I was lucky to catch it immediately. On paper, they should have tap-to-pay as well, but it didn't work. If you tell the driver you are aiming at the Kuala Besut jetty, he will drop you as close to it as possible. Unlike for Tioman, there is no point in booking the ferry to Perhentians in advance. There are agents walking around in front of the jetty looking for customers. My ticket was even cheaper then online (60 MR versus 70 MR). You also have to pay conservation fees (30+20 MR). The ferries are much smaller here (I am not sure they even deserve the name of a \"ferry\"). The ride is very bumpy and windy, but after less than 1 hour you arrive at the islands. Remember to tell the ferry staff where is you hotel located, so that they stop at the right jetty for you. There are 2 islands - Kecil and Besar (a small one and a big one). I stayed at Kecil, so I cannot confirm how the situation on Besar looks like. On Kecil, the snorkeling offers and prices are again the same: 60 RM for the 5-hour trip. My feeling is that the trip was more organized on Tioman. On the other hand, I swam with a turtle up close here. Be prepared for lots of dead coral :( When departing the island, it was extremely chaotic on the jetty. There are dozens of ferry operators, and only a handful guys responsible for directing the tourists to the proper boats. You have to show them your ticket every 5 minutes while waiting, otherwise they will forget about your existence, I felt like. I returned back to Kota Bharu the same way - on the bus #639. To board, just wait at the Kuala Besut bus station. **Ipoh:** this was my transit city on the way to Cameron Highlands, I didn't even spend the night in Ipoh. However, it still might be useful for somebody to hear. I took a night bus from Kota Bharu to Ipoh (the driving is crazy in Malaysia, so it is hardly possible to get some sleep). The bus departs from a different terminal (as I described before), and while the two terminals are not that far from each other (40min walk), it is a challenge to get there on foot: sidewalks or pedestrian crossings are hardly a thing in Kota Bharu. I arrived at Ipoh at 4:30am. The bus terminal is on the city edge, and the first local bus to the city centre departs around 6am, so I was stuck at the terminal. Fortunately, the terminal has relatively clean bathrooms and it was even possible to sleep for a bit. Around 7am, I took a local bus **A30a/A30b** to the city centre (they depart from the upper floor of the terminal). Fortunately, the Ipoh railway station has luggage lockers (unlike the bus terminal) so I left my big backpack there (5 RM per day). You can reach the Mirror lakes and Chinese temples (major attractions) by the local buses as well, but be aware that they might be very late (on my way back, I was waiting for around 30min). In the afternoon, I got back to the bus terminal in order to catch a bus to Cameron Highlands. Remember that Ipoh is one of the cities where you need to \"convert\" your online ticket into a QR code. The bus departed 30min late. **Cameron Highlands:** I stayed at **Tanah Rata** (the town where the bus station is located, and where most tourists stay). No reason to hide, it is very commercialised. There are advantages to that too, I was able to finally do my laundry at a laundromat (8 RM per kg). The next day I took a shared guided tour. There is no reason to book the tour too early, but you should contact a tour operator 2-3 days before the trip. I personally used **Cameron Secrets** (they have very good reviews online), but there are many others. Most of them offer either a half-day tour (40-60 RM) or a full-day tour (80-100 RM); these tours are in a Land Rover and do not involve a lot of walking. I took a full-day tour with the intention of getting the most out of this short stay in Cameron Highlands, but I don't think it was worth it. It might be better to spend the extra time at a short self-guided hike instead; but if you are into strawberry farms or butterfly farms, then go for a full-day tour. In either case, they usually pick you up from your hotel in the morning. **Taman Negara:** to get from Cameron Highlands directly to Taman Negara (or **Kuala Tahan**, to be exact), there are vans departing at 8am by several operators for 90-95 RM. The trip takes 5-6 hours and involves a short bathroom break. There is just 1 ATM in Kuala Tahan, installed very recently, but it is located across the river next to the entrance to the national park. So I advise to take out your cash before coming here. Again, there is no point booking a guided tour in advance. There are multiple tour operators in the village, you can just walk around and approach the one you like the most. I booked two tours at **TME Adventure**: a Night safari (40 RM) and a day trip to the Tras waterfall (180 RM). One thing I can say is that I definitely had too high expectations regarding seeing wild animals: on the day trip we only saw one monkey far in the distance, and some squirrels. However, we were hiking mostly along the river, not very deep in the jungle, so maybe it is possible to find a tour that involves going deeper. Also, it was raining extremely heavy in the evening the day I arrived, and that may also be one of the reasons we missed the animals. This rain was also why the Night safari was postponed to the following day. We did saw a bit more during the Night safari, but still no revelation (mostly insects, also a few scorpions, a couple of hedgehogs, snakes, and allegedly a deer in the distance). **Kuala Lumpur:** there are direct vans from Taman Negara to Kuala Lumpur, but it is significantly cheaper to make a change at a nearby **Jerantut** city. I only found a van from Taman Negara to Jerantut operated by **Danz travel** at 10AM for 35 RM, but there should be other operators offering this connection. From Jerantut to KL, there are normal coaches. For Kuala Lumpur itself, I think there is enough information online, and I don't have anything new to contribute. Maybe just a few things to mention: it felt much hotter in KL than in the previous locations that I visited in Malaysia; for getting up the Petronas Twin Towers you have to book in advance, especially if you want to see the sunset from the top (these evening spots get booked up very quickly). My flight home was from KLIA1 at 10am. I took LRT to **Bandar Tasik Selatan**, and a KLIA Transit train from there (it was not the cheapest option, but I did not want to wake up even earlier to save a few RM). It took me less than 2 hours to get to my gate (which involved taking the internal aerotrain shuttle to the sattelite building, where my gate was located). I had some leftover cash that I wanted to exchange to EUR (as I don't predict another trip in Malaysia in the near future). There are a lot of exchanges at the Departures hall before the immigration, which is were I exchanged my cash. This turned out to be a mistake, because the Satellite building also has some exchange points, and they offer a bit better exchange rate. I have definitely forgotten some details when writing this, so if you have any questions, feel free to comment!", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}
{"id": "bcb3820b71132a76aeea4e37cf3d0f6c", "prompt": "Dublin/Galway Solo Trip Recap", "response": "I recently took a solo trip to Ireland (my first time there) and loved it! A couple of things that really stood out to me- \\-Ireland is maybe the only place in Western Europe where I felt like people were genuinely excited to meet tourists. Maybe because I spent a lot of time in pubs and they were drunk but overall people were friendly. I'm an American who speaks Spanish fluently but have not felt the same kind of welcome in Spain or the UK. Ireland had the friendliest locals of anywhere I've been in Europe and that alone made the trip worth it. \\-Everything is pub centered. I made a habit of watching rugby games there in pubs and found it very easy to strike up a conversation. People love the pubs and they are kind of the center of community there from what I could tell. More on that later but the beer selection is fantastic for my beer aficionados. Galway: I flew from Spain to the Dublin airport and landed and immediately hopped on a cityview bus to Galway. They run every half hour but are about fifty dollars for a round trip. Thats another Ireland is expensive compared to the rest of Europe and I easily spent more than 300$ one day just in food drinks and activities. I have a travel friend in Galway so we met up for an afternoon but the rest of the time I was solo. Galway was smaller than I expected honestly, but felt very Irish. The Irish pubs go seamlessly from a dinner place to live music to club vibes and I honestly loved it. You can sit down and have a beer with dinner watch some quality live music and the next time you stand up its to dance. Locals were friendly and I ended up spending the night in a pub crawl with some students throughout Galway. Scheff's was definetly a highlight. Dublin: I went back to Dublin after a few nights in Galway and spent a couple days checking things out. It’s definitely bigger and more expensive, and while there’s a lot to do, I didn’t like it quite as much as Galway. It felt more like any other European capital — still Irish, but with more of the chain stores, tourists, and bachelor parties you get in big cities. That said, there’s good stuff. The Guinness Factory was definetly worth it. It’s about two hours start to finish and ends with a freshly poured pint in the top-floor bar that overlooks the city. If you’re into beer even a little, it’s a good stop. Just don’t expect it to be some small-scale authentic brewery tour — it’s very much a big production, but a fun one. I also checked out Trinity College. The library is cool, but they charge about 25 euros just to see the Book of Kells, which felt like a bit much. Dublin Castle was okay, but kind of forgettable if you’ve been to other European castles. One thing Dublin does better than most cities is conversation. I had full-on chats with strangers at every pub I went to. You’re not going to sit quietly and sip your pint — people talk to each other, and that makes it feel very different from places like London or even Madrid. Overall, I liked Dublin, but I preferred Galway by a mile. If I go back, I’ll spend more time outside the capital — the charm of Ireland really comes through in the smaller towns, although calling it a solo trip almost feels like cheating because I was talking to and meeting people the entire time.", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

I (M25) travel 2 – 4 times a year for vacation and most of my long distance trips end up being to Asia.

Some (and I‘m talking actually quite a few) people around me have started to comment on it like“Why don’t you check out other parts of the world?“, or even that it’s strange how fixated I seem to be on Asia. But the thing is I’ve never been to the same country twice. I’m not going to one familiar spot over and over again, I’m exploring different cultures, food and vibes within incredibly diverse continent. But people that haven‘t been (which are most of those who make said comments) don‘t seem to grasp that Theres a difference between Japan and China and Korea and Thailand. They merge those into „Asia“. For me it just fits though: I love Most of the food, the cultural richness, the general atmosphere and honestly what’s a very important point for me as a solo traveller, I feel very safe as a solo traveler in most Asian countries. It aligns with what I personally value when I travel like safety, good public transport and interesting culture. I‘m always so so so excited when travelling East. Still, it has me wondering: Is it weird to focus so much on one continent? Am I limiting myself without realizing it? Also, just a random thought but I don‘t notice people making similar remarks to colleagues that „always“ Travel to Thailand or Spain, which could be Seen as even more limiting. Have any of you experienced this kind of pull toward one region, even while trying to stay open-minded? Did you eventually “force” yourself to explore elsewhere, or just follow your interests?

I've been stuck on a couple of options — for example, should I try to make it to Lake Como? And if so, for a day trip? Or two days? Or should I go straight to Verona and pair it up with Lake Garda? I'd ideally like to perch in a lovely little town and just laze about for a couple of days too, and drink in the scenery... I was thinking of Bologna, perhaps, or Verona, or Modena, or Cremona... but also want to limit the amount of schlepping I have to do as I get to/from Milan and Venice.

After some changes I quit my job and sold all my stuff and headed south on my motorcycle, thinking maybe I’ll take 6 months to ‘get it out of my system’ and then come back to my white picket fence. That was 2 years ago and I’m still living alone off my bike. It’s been one once-in-a-lifetime experience after another, a beautiful kaleidoscope of new landscapes, cities, and friends. From hiding away from paramilitaries in the swamps of Colombia to collapsing in the warm sanctuary of a lover’s colonial home in Mexico, to embracing a childhood friend visiting me in the mountains of Guatemala, never in my adult life has my heart felt so awake. It’s still life, there are plenty of bad times, but even they feel like they have taught me something about myself. I am solo, but never really alone. Constantly I’m adopted by other groups of backpackers or moto travelers, or locals. Some connections are fleeting but many of us keep in touch: I return to cities I’ve visited before to see my friends again, and many of my traveler buddies have come to visit me in different parts of my journey. I’ve just turned 35 and will soon reach the end of this particular trip. But I feel myself spiraling away from any interest in the sedentary life I had before. I’m sitting here a guest at the home of an Italian diplomat high up in the Andes, being force fed her lasagna and wondering if I might be happiest living this way for many years to come… Pardon the rant. I’m interested to hear the stories of others who have had similar experiences and how it worked out for them.

Before and during a serious relationship I had at the time, I was excited about my trips. I wanted to discover new places, make my own memories, do new things, and meet people on the way. At 29 last year my relationship broke up, and suddenly solo trips weren't the same anymore. Suddenly I feel empty during them and intensely feel the absence of someone to share the experience with. I have done a couple of solo trips even when I was with my ex, and they felt exciting and meaningful. Trips with or visiting friends are ok and i don't feel as empty, but on my last solo trip I felt almost pathetic. I'm not very extroverted in general, not starting conversations myself most of the time, though I'm usually happy to respond to people who want to talk to me. So I don't often make exciting connections during travels. Again, 2-4 years ago this didn't bother me, but now it suddenly does and I return feeling empty from a solo trip after not meeting people in any particularly meaningful way. I don't know what has really changed. But these days my only option to travel is solo and I dread doing that. Maybe it was having the choice to go solo or with someone that made the difference.

{"id": "994b829f88f2be1fa84afd8d0bdd3dfa", "prompt": "Looking for feedback for my trip to Italy", "response": "Hi all, I am planning a trip to Bari and the nearby places. I am planning on going for one week at the end of July/beginning of August. My plan is the following: I will spend the first 1-2 days fully in Bari, walking around the city and checking all the attractions and landmarks: the Old City, the Basilica, Teatro Petruzzelli, Teatro Margherita, Castello Normanno-Svevo, the Piazzas, Lungomare, the beach and Zoosafari Fasanolandia. Day 3 visit Matera (since there is a stop in Altamura, is it worth checking?) Day 4 visit Alberobello Day 5 visit Monopoli and Polignano a Mare Day 6 visit Locorotondo or Lecce. Lecce is a larger city, and I am not sure if I will have the energy and time to check out all the interesting stuff in it in this last full day that I will have in Italy. Checking on the map, all landmarks are near each other, so I guess it is manageable? I might swap it with one of the other days, but all other places seem too interesting to miss as well. I can always return to this region, though, but I'm still not quite sure about it. Day 7 is my return flight. Now, I might change the order of the places that I will visit, but all in all, this is how I plan on doing my trip. I want to spend the first 1 or 2 days fully in Bari so that I can delve entirely into the atmosphere of the city and then make the other travels. Also, from what I've read in many posts, Bari is very possible to be explored in full in 1 whole day, so I might have time to add both cities from the \"Day 6\" section. I do not want to rush myself, though; I will not be speedrunning the areas. I will most probably not be renting a car, so I will rely entirely on trains and buses. From what I've checked, trains and buses are a good transport in Italy, so there shouldn't be any issues with delays and whatnot? Is that true? Obviously I do not want to spend a lot of time traveling between places, as this will eat up my day, and I would hate that. Two hours is the absolute most that I am willing to travel between cities. I might consider renting a car if I will be going to the Zoosafari, though. I suppose there are organized tours, but would they be worth the money, or would it be better to rent a car? I am looking for any sort of feedback on my itinerary. Do you think it's feasible time-wise? Would it be too much to see for these 7 days? Should I buy tickets for the galleries and museums online beforehand or it is not necessary? Would you swap any of the places that I will be visiting with another one? Should I book bus/train tickets online beforehand, or can I buy them directly at the stations? Which app is the best one that I should use for buying them online and for checking the timetables?", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

{"id": "9b6fc38ff4749f0c768b6922459798f5", "prompt": "Trip Report - 9 Days in Peru in May 2025", "response": "I visited Peru two months ago and wanted to share a writeup of my experience in case it is helpful for other people. I tried sharing this yesterday on the travel subreddit but it got deleted by the moderators there almost instantly and they won't give me an explanation, I guess they don't like travel writeups there. So I figured I'd share it with you all here since it was a solo trip anyway. **BACKGROUND** * Before I went, I talked with my doctor, who prescribed some acetazolamide for me to help with altitude sickness. This stuff worked pretty well for me in that I didn't have any headaches, but I do think I still experienced some of the other effects of altitude sickness. Anyone planning to go to the high altitude areas of Peru may want to check with their doctors to see if it's appropriate for them to take it. * I brought a small suitcase with me, with enough clothes to last half the trip. I planned on doing laundry halfway through the trip. I'm a pretty tall guy though so my clothes are pretty big, and I needed to bring a sweater and jacket there, so a small suitcase wasn't really ideal. I brought a DSLR with me too. * I had my entire itinerary planned out but I left lots of room for flexibility. The things that weren't flexible were my three tours booked through GetYourGuide, trains to and from Aguas Calientes, and Machu Picchu. I only made one restaurant reservation in advance - Chicha in Cusco. I put myself on the waitlist for a few high end restaurants in Lima too, but nothing confirmed prior to my trip. * I took a few semesters of Spanish in high school but I retained almost none of it. But I still know some really basic vocabulary. So other than numbers, I pretty much only used English. **REPORT** *5/3 CUSCO* * I landed in Lima late at night on 5/2 and had dinner at Tanta in the airport. However my flight to Cusco wasn't until 5am the next morning so I hung out at the food court until 1am, then went through my gate and slept a bit. * My flight was delayed for about an hour. My hotel offered a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel, and I had arranged it ahead of time. However, because of the delay, the driver ended up leaving without me because the other passenger wanted to get going. So I ended up having to take a taxi from the airport to the hotel. The hotel apologized for the misunderstanding. * Got breakfast in the hotel, then walked a bit around Plaza de Armas, some shops, and saw the 12-angled stone. * Around 11am my hotel room was ready so I went back to the hotel and took a quick nap, since I didn't sleep very well at the airport. * Around 3pm I finally went out again to get lunch. I wanted to go to Morena Peruvian Kitchen but they had a two hour wait, so I went to nearby Inkagrill and got a sopa andina and an alpaca steak. * I walked around some more and did some souvenir shopping. I walked past Kusykay and decided I would go there for dinner but anticipated they would be busy, so I walked in to ask if I could make a reservation for that night, and got one at 8pm. * Took another break in the hotel until 8pm, at which time I went back to Kusykay for my dinner reservation. I got their grilled vegetable appetizer and the guinea pig. They bring it out with a hat and poncho after they roast it so you can take pictures of it, then bring it back to the kitchen to cut it up. I thought it tasted kinda like quail. It was good, but not something I would go out of my way for. *5/4 CUSCO* * Started off with an early breakfast in the hotel, then headed out to San Pedro Market. I tried some juice from one of the stands there. * At 9am I met up with my tour group to see the Incan ruins close to Cusco. It started in Tambomachay, then went to Puka Pukara, then stopped by a Quechua-owned alpaca goods store, then Q'enco, and finally Sacsayhuaman. Overall the tour was good. But we had one annoying guy on the tour who didn't bother converting any currency and assumed everyone would accept American currency, so our tour was periodically halted so that the tour guide could help him make his transactions. * One disappointing thing about this tour was that it was supposed to include Qoricancha, but since it was Sunday we didn't go there because it was closed. They didn't put any disclaimer on their tour description about this, so I should have been a bit smarter about this to plan around it. * We got back to central Cusco around 2:30, at which point I needed to get lunch. I tried Morena again but they once again had a two hour await. So I went to nearby Limo and got some ceviche. * After that quick meal, I headed up to San Blas, and it also began raining. Despite taking altitude medication, the uphill walk was still tough on the lungs. I went to Plaza San Blas, then to the viewpoint above town, and then continued around to the Sapantiana Aqueduct and Calle Siete Borreguitos before finally getting to the viewpoint outside San Cristobal Cathedral. This is around the time the rain ended, and I was exhausted. * I headed back downhill and made it to my dinner reservation at Chicha. However, I lost my appetite at this point, I think it was an effect of the altitude. So unfortunately I couldn't enjoy this meal as much as I wanted to. *5/5 LAGUNA HUMANTAY* * I woke up at 3am to get ready for a 4am pickup to go to Laguna Humantay. I was able to sleep on the tiny little bus until we got to the restaurant for breakfast. I think I still lost my appetite from the previous day so I didn't eat very much. It also started raining, which wasn't a good sign. * We arrived at the base of the mountain around 7:30am and began walking. Again, despite having the medication for altitude sickness, I was still having a tough time breathing. No headaches though. I wanted to get a horse, but there weren't any available from the starting point. We had to walk pretty far, basically the start of the steep slope, before we actually were able to find a horse rental area. Unfortunately, as a tall guy, the horse rental lady told me I was too big for her horses. My tour guide (who was freakin awesome) said that there was another rental area a little downhill of where we were, so he brought me there and I was able to get a bigger horse there. The caveat was that the bigger horse cost almost double what the other place cost. But it was worth it, because with the altitude I was not really cut out to complete this hike on foot. I rode the horse to almost the top of the mountain, and then it was just a short five minute hike to the lake itself. * When I got to the lake, the rest of my tour group was already there (since they all either hiked or didn't have horse troubles like I did). It was super foggy up here, but there were very brief moments where the fog subsided and you could see the lake. Couldn't see the snow-covered mountain behind it though. The thing I learned about this excursion is that apparently the majority of tours go in the morning and they all have this problem where the lake is obscured. But if you go in the afternoon, there's a better chance for seeing the lake, and all the other tourists will be gone so it's a lot more quiet up there too. I don't think it would have made much of a difference this day though because it rained. * On the descent, we had some rain, which made for a really unpleasant walk through the mud and horse shit. And then when we were most of the way back, they shut off part of the trail, and required us to walk down an alternate trail which involved hiking back up and then down a makeshift trail along the side of a steep slope that was just mud. I fell a few times so my pants and jacket were pretty muddy by the time I got to the parking lot. My tour guide helped me down the side of the slope, so I tipped him very well at the end because it felt like he went above and beyond for me this day. * We went back to the same restaurant to have lunch. It was again a buffet, but despite having just gone hiking, I still didn't have my appetite back, so I only ate half a plate. From there, we went back to Cusco and got back around 6pm. * I got changed in my hotel, rested a bit, then went to Morena around 7pm to get dinner. For the third time, they told me it would be a two hour wait. But since this would be my last night in Cusco, I decided to put myself on the waiting list. I just sat in their lobby, on a very comfy couch, for two hours listening to podcasts before I got seated. Now I finally had my appetite back, and it was good timing because this was easily the best restaurant I ate at in Cusco. I ordered chicken soup, gnocchi de aji de gallina, and chocolate ice cream. *5/6 SACRED VALLEY* * Woke up around 5am, finished packing, then got a quick breakfast in the hotel, and checked out. Was picked up around 6:30am for a Sacred Valley tour. * The tour first stopped in a small shop in Chinchero where a local lady demonstrated how alpaca clothing is made. Then we saw the archaeological sites in Chinchero, Moray, and the Maras Salt Mines. We got lunch at a buffet in Urabamba, at which point it started raining. We then went to Ollantaytambo, and fortunately it stopped raining on the hike up. The tour finished around 4pm, and I headed to the train station to catch my train to Aguas Calientes at 4:36pm. * The train ride wasn't particularly comfortably. There were lots of rowdy tourists who were loud the entire time and tried to sneak in some smoking on board. The couple sitting across from me hogged the entire table. The woman sitting next to me kept pushing my arm to try to give herself more space. I should have tried to get a ticket on a fancier car. There wasn't much to see either since it got dark around this time. * In Aguas Calientes, I walked up to my hotel and rested a bit, then went out for dinner at Indio Feliz. I tried alpaca carpaccio and mango chicken. *5/7 MACHU PICCHU* * This was my birthday. The hotel actually made note of this and made sure all their staff knew. When I went to the breakfast buffet, the waitress there immediately said happy birthday to me when I told her my room number. And the front desk people said happy birthday to me as well. * I spent the morning walking around Aguas Calientes, taking photos, and got coffee at Ollantay Cafe. Then I got lunch at Full House, where I ordered leche de tigre and chicharron. Not bad, but not great either. * My entry to Machu Picchu was at 3pm. I was in line around 1:45pm. My ticket was for Circuit 2B. It was also pretty hectic because tourists here were pretty unruly, trying to edge each other out of their way to take photos. I kinda stood back and let the majority of people go past me first, so that I didn't have as many people behind me. * Machu Picchu itself was awesome. I took lots of photos. I didn't go with a guide and took my time looking around the different structures and viewpoints. I left the site a little past 5pm. * Back in my hotel, I got a message from Central Restaurant in Lima saying that I was selected off the waitlist for lunch on 5/9. I told them I'd take the reservation. * For dinner I went to Chullos, where I ordered pulpo al olivo to start, and anticuchos as my main. Was a fantastic meal, and the restaurant was very relaxing compared to the other ones I saw in town. *5/8 TRAVEL DAY* * Got a quick breakfast in my hotel, then headed down to the train station to go back to Ollantaytambo. There I got on the bus to go back to Cusco. I was unfortunately seated next to this rude couple. The ride is too bumpy to sleep, and I probably wouldn't have been able to anyway since the couple would not shut up the entire ride to Cusco. The guy kept trying to subtle push me away from him to give himself more space too. * It started raining hard in Cusco, so that spoiled my plan of visiting Qoricancha. Instead I walked to San Pedro Market, and got caldo de gallina and another fruit juice. * I got a taxi to the airport (arranged by hotel from earlier in the week). Unfortunately my flight was delayed by about two hours, so I got to Lima pretty late. * In Lima, my hotel sent a driver to pick me up. I felt bad that he waited there for almost two hours. I got to Miraflores around 9:30pm, then went to get dinner at Panchita where I got ceviche and lomo saltado. *5/9 LIMA* * I had originally planned to do the historic center of Lima this day. But with the restaurant reservation that I was fortunate to receive, I shifted everything around. * I slept in, then took an Uber to Barranco. I walked around a bit in the plaza, then at the Bridge of Sighs. I got a quick drink at La Bodega Verde as I walked around. * My lunch reservation to Central was at 1:15pm. This was a pretty awesome experience, over three hours long, featuring foods from all over Peru, with a theme of each dish being made of ingredients coming from a specific elevation. It's a very casual atmosphere despite being considered the best restaurant in the world. Near the end they offered me a tour of their cacao experimentation lab, and the chef came out to each table to thank every person individually for dining there. * I left Central around 5 and went back to my hotel to nap a bit. Then I went back out around 9pm for dinner. I went to Anticucho Dona Pochita for their famous anticuchos, then walked a few blocks over to get sopa criolla from Siete Sopas. *5/10 LIMA* * I started off by taking an Uber to Plaza San Martin. From there I walked to Sangucheria El Chinito. As a Chinese American, I really like seeing how Chinese people establish themselves in other countries, so it was really interesting reading about this sandwich shop's history. * I walked to Iglesia Las Nazarenas, then to Basilica and Convent of Santo Domingo. Then I walked to Plaza de Armas and the Catedral de Lima. There were some things going on out front because of the newly selected pope. * For lunch, I walked to Chinatown. It was so crowded here, it felt like I was shuffling around. It was an interesting experience for me because it had a lot of elements I was familiar with from other Chinatowns, but the shopkeepers were all people of mixed Peruvian-Chinese backgrounds and didn't seem to actually speak Chinese. I ate at Chun Koc Sen, and ordered duck fried rice, but no one there spoke any Chinese other than the owner. * After lunch, I walked a bit more to get out of the super busy/chaotic part of Chinatown and saw a few shops, then took an Uber back to my hotel in Miraflores. I walked from my hotel to Malecon, and by this point it was almost sunset. Was able to get some great photos of the parks, the ocean, and the paragliders. * I took another Uber, this time to El Circuito Magico del Agua to watch the water light displays. * I returned to Miraflores to get a late dinner. Across from my hotel was a restaurant called Tomo Cocina Nikkei. I didn't have a reservation, but they were doing last call so I was able to sit at their bar and get an order in before they closed. I got a few pieces of sushi (with Peruvian influence) and guanciale udon. * I was still a bit hungry so I walked to a nearby Siete Sopas and got caldo de gallina. This one was okay, but it didn't beat the one I had in the market in Cusco. *5/11 LIMA* * This was my final day in Peru. I started with breakfast in the hotel. Then I left all my luggage at the front desk after checking out. From the hotel, I walked to the nearby Miraflores Central Park and Parque Kennedy, where there were lots of local artists trying to sell their artwork. * I took an Uber to Barranco again, and went to Isolina. This was a restaurant I saw listed on many must-try lists so I gave it a shot, and got seated without a reservation. I ordered the cau cau con sangrecita. * Afterwards, I headed to Museo Larco. I checked out their primary exhibit, then went to their infamous erotic pottery exhibit after. * My last stop was Huaca Pucllana. I got there just before an English guided tour started and was able to join them. Afterwards, I finished off my time there at a nearby cafe where I ordered lucuma ice cream. * From Huaca Pucllana, I walked back to my hotel, picked up my luggage, and the hotel arranged a driver for me to get to the airport. I ate dinner once again at Tanta. I ordered another lomo saltado and killed time in the restaurant until my late flight back home to the United States. **CONCLUSION** If you made it through all of that, thanks for reading it all. I hope this is helpful for anyone interested in visiting Peru, particularly Cusco and Lima, and are curious about how much time to budget for certain things. Overall, I'm glad I was able to make this trip finally happen. I had originally planned it for 2020 but had to cancel it because of the pandemic. My original plans had Arequipa in it, but I had certain commitments back home so I cut the trip down by a few days and focused just on the Cusco area and Lima. I'm glad I went to Lima as I love traveling to try out new food.

Trip Length: 6 nights in early July (originally planned 5, extended to 6, and honestly wish I stayed longer) Destination(s): São Paulo (2 nights) Rio de Janeiro (4 nights) Accommodation: • São Paulo - Qoya Hotel on Avenida Paulista - felt extremely safe and luxurious. The service exceeded expectations (escorted to Ubers, robe/slippers, spa-like experience). Highly recommend. • Rio De Janeiro - More Ipanema Hostel - super social with tons of daily free activities (walking tours, hikes, beach games, parties). Met lots of travelers and made friends easily. Activities: • São Paulo: MASP, SESC Paulista, Beco do Batman, Liberdade, Museum of Favelas, and a walking tour through Vila Madalena • Rio: Ipanema/Leblon beach days, Dois Irmãos hike, Pedra do Sal party (wild night ending in surprise teargas), Feira de Glória, Feira de Hippie, nightlife in Botafogo, local restaurants including Bibi Sucos (açaí), Amelie, and Maria e o Boi (Michelin-recommended) What Went Right: • I felt prepared: dressed down, used a backup phone, wore a crossbody bag & kept valuables in a lockable travel safe • Airalo eSIM worked great once I topped up (get more than 1GB!) • Met cool locals and other travelers • Practiced my Portuguese every day and had no issue navigating or connecting • Ipanema and Leblon felt pretty safe vs Copacabana • Even with the safety concerns, I never had anything happen to me directly and I saw some of the best views of my life What Went Wrong: • Nearly ran out of data on day one (rookie mistake) • Saw two chain-snatching incidents right outside my hostel (one failed, one successful, neither victim was hurt) • Got randomly teargassed outside Pedra do Sal late one night • Anxiety leading up to the trip nearly made me cancel bc I was spooked by Reddit posts and stories from Brazilian friends Recommendations: • Dress casual, wear Havaianas, and don’t flash your phone • Carry a cheaper backup phone if you’re nervous about theft • Stay in Ipanema or Leblon if you’re worried about safety • Use Uber over walking or public transit unless you’re with someone (i used Black) • Use a crossbody/chest bag, locals do it too • Be alert, not paranoid, everyone takes precautions, even locals • Learn a little Portuguese, even a small effort goes a long way! Final Verdict: Despite all the fear mongering & horror stories I heard, I went solo, had an amazing time, and would absolutely go again. Rio might be my favorite city now. It has such a charm to it. it’s beautiful, raw, fun, & alive. You just have to move smart. If you’ve been on the fence about Brazil, I say go! just go prepared. I’m not gonna lie tho, I almost canceled this trip 2 days before leaving after seeing a post on r/Brazil about a couple getting robbed at gunpoint in a nice neighborhood I was eyeing for Airbnbs. I spiraled and searched “robbed in Brazil” on Reddit and YouTube and fell into a rabbit hole of worst case stories. Definitely don’t recommend doing that before your trip lol. What pulled me back was going through the IG reels that first inspired me to visit. Seeing solo travelers, especially women, taking the leap and making it work gave me courage. If they could do it, why not me? So I did my research, took all the precautions I could, & stayed aware, and I’m glad I did. Because this trip turned out to be one of the best I’ve ever had. TL;DR: Went solo to Brazil (São Paulo and Rio) despite constant safety warnings. Took precautions, stayed alert, and had an amazing trip. Rio might be my favorite city now. Don’t let fear stop you, just be smart and go prepared. Happy to answer any questions!

I've travelled in the past, but always with someone. This will be my first time solo travelling, I'm 34M, little apprehensive, but I make friends easily enough, so not overly worried. I'm flying to Thailand in 3 weeks, and have a 12 day Thai Intro tour booked. I did a similar thing in Australia a while ago, but this was with an ex partner. Currently I have no plans. I have no idea how long I intend to go for - I might just do the 60 days in Thailand and go home, or might want to continue for a few months. I have roughly £10k I an use, and a bit more if I really need. Based on a couple friends advice provably enough to go for up to 9 months. Between now and when I go I will obviously be looking at specific places I want to visit and the sights that stand out to me as must-sees, and have a couple fitness or wellness retreats saved so I can shoot to one if I need a week break to relax. I’m mainly looking at Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bali as places to go. But really, I'm pretty chill and like to go with the flow. I was hoping to meet some people during the intro trip to tag along with after, and sort of keep that going. Keep bumping into new groups or other solo travellers who I get on with and like the idea of where they're going next. Just wondering how realistic that is, I really do like to just see what happens but so many people I've spoken to about it do seem to have a general plan of where they're going and in what order (though they weren't going solo). Can I just totally wing it (by choosing to tag with people I like going to places I want to see), or do I at least need a general plan that's adaptable based on the people I meet (such as pre-booking hostel/hotels in those specific countries beforehand)?", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

I'm F23, and I have 9 weeks (mid Sept-mid Nov) to solo travel. I originally had my heart set on a trip through Chile ending in Patagonia. I was literally planning to book my plane tickets the next day, but after a convo with a friend, I started to reconsider due to extreme travel costs even whilst backpacking (some hostels as 25 euros/night) and it may be harder to meet other travelers around my age (mostly 30+). Now i'm thinking about saving this dream trip for a couple years down the road and going to Colombia instead for 5 weeks (as my first destination, the rest of the time in Guatemala) as I often hear Colombia to be travelers' favourite destination. I definitiely see the appeal but I guess I am still not fully convinced on what makes it so special. I'm curious what specifically made Colombia so memorable—is it more a certain vibe and so something you need to experience firsthand? So here are my questions: 1. **What were your Colombia highlights/what made it so special?** 2. **Is the nature impactful in Colombia/is it a highlight?** What really excited me about Chile and Patagonia was the nature I was going to experience - the mountains and vast landscapes. I know that Colombia is a different climate and there is also nature but wanted to get your perspective if the nature in Colombia is also impactful/something that stuck with you. 3. **Is it easy to meet people whilst solo travelling outside the party scene? Or will I be missing out for not partying so much?** I want to meet people and am social however I love meeting people through activites such as hikes or casually in hostels (communical kitchens/breakfasts etc) rather than in a nightlife/drinking setting. My rough plan would be to keep my days in the big cities (Medellin & bogota) to a minimum and be looking for more of a hiking & activities based travel like visiting: salento/jardin/ guatapa/palomino/minca/barichara/san gil.

I feel like im tired of the same motions of getting to know people, tired of not appreciating my surroundings, and tired of bringing myself out of the hostel to see or do things just because its something to do. I keep thinking back to my first 1-3 months of travel and I can genuinely say it was the best time of my life.

My friends are there but everyone is so independent now, no one wants to plan or organise things and just generally I feel like I'd fall into the same headspace I've felt like I've always been in living in the UK - im 26, so im also at an age where I eventually want to move out, but for now I genuinely don't feel like the UK feels like home, and somewhere I want to settle. Apologies if this feels closer to a rant rather than advice, but I'd love to hear if anyone has gone through the same motions. Ultimately, I feel like I started this trip just to escape my mundane life in the UK, and now my money is almost gone, maybe I can't enjoy or appreciate my surroundings properly. Has anyone else ever had these feelings during a big trip like this? I'd be especially curious to know if anyone else also felt like this whilst knowing they'd be worse off if they returned to their home country?", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

It would be this March to Costa Rica (Monteverde/Montevideo). I haven’t actually booked anything yet but I was super excited and ready to start in the next week or two. My parents are not happy with my decision. When I first brought the idea up they were obviously not pleased but they didn’t actually say anything to try to discourage me from going. I brought it up again this morning and my father said that if I go without a friend/family member he and my mother will not support me while I’m at college. They don’t pay for my tuition so thankfully that isn’t a concern but all other expenses would be on me. I am super disappointed by this. It’s difficult for me to bring a friend as I’m going into my freshman year and all my high school friends are going to different schools with different spring break times than mine. Obviously I don’t know anyone at my university yet.

{"id": "969dce884703049e405bd413a4da3138", "prompt": "How do I progress towards international solo travel?", "response": "Hi Reddit, I (19M) have always dreamed of solo travelling across the world. However, I am limited in my ability to have a \"conventional\" travel experience in many places because of extensive food allergies. My plan for a first trip was to travel from my hometown of Melbourne to Singapore, stay for a few days, and then spend around ten days travelling through Malaysia before flying back home from KL. I chose this route because south east asia is most interesting to me, as well as for the fact that Singapore might be a slightly easier introduction to the region since I have uni friends that live there, and from researching I heard english is more widely known. However, I would be open to a different destination if it is more appropriate to ease me into solo travel. Last month, I took a solo trip to Sydney and had a blast staying in a hostel for just a few days. I would be open to further domestic travel, but I also feel that seeing the best of Australia requires a car, which I don't have access to since I cannot drive yet. My parents are supportive of me travelling in general, but mum strongly prefers for me to travel domestically and is worried about my ability to manage my allergies on my own in a foreign country, while dad is largely uninvolved. I understand her concerns and genuinely understand how scary it must be for my parents, but ultimately I am an adult, plan on making sensible choices, and have managed my own health before on a regular basis. It's not that they won't let me travel, but they want me to be safe. I have said that I could take a friend, but they said it's not about the street smarts, it's about the allergy situation. Besides that, I don't know how to progress with my dream at all, and I'm feeling stuck. I guess what I'm asking for is if anybody has another way that I could argue the case to them. I'm happy to take any suggestions at all, including further domestic travel first, or changing destinations to be more friendly to allergies.", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

{"id": "4b15b847020c457dcba26186237ae473", "prompt": "[trip report] island hopping in the Indian ocean", "response": "I recently returned from a trip to the western Indian Ocean, where I spent time on four different islands. Those of you reaching for a map are possibly thinking there aren't any significant islands in the western Indian Ocean. Oh but there are, if you zoom in far enough. Just off the southeast coast of the African continent are several islands, including La Reunion (part of France!), Mauritius, Seychelles & Madagascar. All of which are actually considered geographically and geologically part of Africa. Overall, the trip went well, despite a few (very) minor problems. I'll break this down by island, and add some logistical details at the end. * La Reunion (mostly referred to as simply Reunion): this is a fantastic place if you love hiking/nature. There are dozens (perhaps hundreds) of hiking opportunities all over this fairly small island (you could drive the outer loop road in less than a day). I spent 4 days/3 nights (the first day was my arrival just after sunrise, and the last day was just going to the airport before sunrise for my onward flight). * My first (arrival) day I did some fairly basic short hikes along the south western side of the island. First was Piton de Grand Anse, which is a fairly short (maybe ~3km) loop trail on the hills/cliffs overlooking the ocean. Next was Cap Mechant, which is a much smaller version of Grand Anse, with a much more volcanic feel. Finally, I drove up into the interior mountains to see Cascade de Grand Galet, a really pretty broad series of waterfalls down the cliff face. * Second day started off with my rental car having a dead battery, which significantly delayed my plans. But I still managed to drive up to Piton de la Fournaise (a massive, very active, shield volcano) to do the hike to the summit. This hike had spectacular scenery, but was fairly brutal/strenuous for a number of reasons. The total distance was around 11km (not too bad). The first 25% of the hike is across as relatively flat lava plain, with cinder cones and the volcano looming on the horizon. After that, its almost non-stop climbing the side of the volcano. First, 99% of the hike is across lava flows, so I was literally hiking on very uneven, tortured, sharp rocks. Second, the elevation change for the hike was over 500m. Finally, the elevation of the hike is around 2500m, which was an issue for me, when I live near sea level. Was it worth it, yes. But my lungs burned, I was nearly always afraid of falling & getting injured on the lava, and due to my late start, I was afraid of not finishing the hike before sunset (which would have been super bad considering the terrain). This is a super popular hiking destination on the island. Likely hundreds of people/day hike out to the lava plain to see the lava & cinder cones, and many dozens continue beyond to climb the volcano. I ran into other hikers every few minutes, so this is definitely not a hike if you want solitude in nature. Most were French speakers, but there were a small, but non-trivial number of English speakers as well. * Third day, I drove up into the mountains again, and hiked out to Trou de Fer. The road up there was fully paved, but basically just a single lane (for both directions). This hike ended at a view point for a spectacular water fall (which was discovered only back in 1989). The key word on this hike is mud. Much (but not all) of the trail is on wooden planks (in an effort to keep you out of the mud), but the planks are not all in good condition. And there were a lot of (minor) elevation changes, where the \"steps\" were basically just nasty mud pits that sucked your feet in. That said, it was a very pretty hike through dense forest (with huge fern trees & wild flowers), and the water fall view at the end lived up to the hype. While the trail wasn't crowded with other hikers, it was definitely not empty either. I'd say I passed another person maybe every 10-15 minutes. Almost everyone was a French speaker. * Mauritius: former British colony (they drive on the left). Overall, kinda disappointing. I spent 3 days/2 nights here, and was kinda bored. This is a great place if you enjoy laying on a beach, or generally doing beach/sea activities. Not a lot of hiking opportunities, relatively speaking. There are a ton of huge, all-inclusive resorts, often with their own private beaches. I stayed at one resort, because I got an amazing deal, but it was a very meh experience overall. There's a bunch of stuff to do in the Chamarel area (a tourist trap called \"7 Earths\" which has some very over priced \"trails\"), and a pretty damn good rum distillery. The La Morne Brabant area is visually stunning scenery. Its also very expensive (a lot of the beaches are inaccessible unless you are a guest at one of the 5 star resorts). * Seychelles: also a former British colony (drive on the left), comprised of several inhabited islands. I liked this way more than Mauritius, mostly because it had far better hiking opportunities, and felt much less \"packaged for tourists\". I spent 5 days/4 nights, although the first day was arriving after sunset, and the last day was basically just going to the airport for my onward flight. I only had time to explore the main island, with the capitol, Victoria. My hotel was 10 minutes drive north of the town of Beau Vallon on the west coast of the island. * Second day had kinda iffy weather. It was raining and gloomy. I ended up hiking the Copolia trail. Seychelles has a lot of \"national park\" managed relatively short hiking trails that are in good condition. The only catch is they all require an entry fee (which varies based on the trail). They only accept cards for payment at the trail head, so not difficult, but a bit of a pain for a trail that is often less than 3km (each way). Copolia was through a fairly dense forest, with the sound of rushing water off in the distance. I saw one one other group of hikers, but otherwise, it was just me in the forest for ~2 hours. I was also considering doing the Tres Freres trail, but didn't feel like paying another US$6 to do a 2 hour hike that was supposed to be very similar to Copolia over all. I was also planning to check out the nearby Venn's Town Ruins (ghosttown), but this has seemingly morphed into a tourist trap with an entry fee (it used to be just a thing you wandered into in the forest for a few minutes to explore), so I skipped it as well. Spent the rest of the day exploring the western side of the island, and had a fantastic lunch literally overlooking a completely empty beach. * Third day was a snorkelling tour in the Saint Anne Marine National Park. Lots of operators offer some version of this tour using the same template and varying pricing. I booked in advance with one company that had good reviews that seemed to be locally owned/run. This was a great experience overall. My only criticism was that they used a fairly small boat, and packed 19 passengers plus 4 crew onto it, which felt cramped and maybe unsafe if there was an accident. The group was diverse in terms of nationalities (British, Botswanan, Russian, Italian). The tour started at 10am and wrapped up just before 5pm. We deported from the boat docks on Eden Island, headed barely 15 minutes off shore to Cerf Island, where we snorkeled for an hour. Water was a bit choppy, with a lot of wind, but we still got to see a ton of coral & fish. Next we headed in the direction of Long Island, but stopped half way, where they handed out slices of bread to everyone to \"feed the fish\". I'm not a fan of this practice (for all the reasons why people are generally not permitted to feed wild animals), and didn't participate, but I will acknowledge that it did entice an insane number of pretty tropical fish around the boat. After maybe 15 minutes, we circled clockwise around the island and dropped anchor on Long Island where the crew setup in the shade of the trees to make lunch. Everyone else was free to wander/explore the island where the ruins of an unfinished resort sit on a small hill. It was also possible (at low tide) to wade through the very shallow water over to Round Island, which has its own private resort. Lunch was grilled fish, chicken hotdogs, and a bunch of sides. Food was _fine_ but nothing memorable. After that we got back in the boat, and motored 5 minutes over to Moyenne Island, which is the world's smallest national park. This island has a long, storied history, but is now a protected national park with a tortoise sanctuary, loop hiking trail (barely 2km total), and beach bar (with lots of great tropical drinks). They gave us 1 hour total here, which was sufficient to hike the loop, see dozens of massive tortoises, and enjoy a mango-passion-colada. Ideally, I would have loved to spend maybe another hour so I could take everything at a slower pace, but such is life on a group tour. After that, we got back on the boat, circled around to the far side of the island, and snorkelled for the second (and final) time of the day (although this stop was barely 30 minutes long). Then we headed back after 15 minutes, and ended the tour. Overall a really nice day, and for me the highlight was Moyenne Island (more so than the snorkelling). * Forth day started with a drive up to the north side of the island to do the Anse Major trail (NP, had another entry fee). Its a pretty trail, mostly on a cliff over looking the ocean, with a lot of huge boulders, sun exposure, and insane humidity. Total distance was 2km (each way), so not much, but there's a lot of elevation changes, so its not that easy. A decent number of other people were also hiking. Parking is extremely limited at the trail head area (which seemed to be the case for the other trails too). After the hike, I drove clear across the island to the south east to check out the Takamaka Rum distillery. This is a big deal (for locals at least), and is insanely popular. The parking area was absolutely packed when I arrived, and the entire setup felt extremely touristy. Which is fine, but the rum tasting itself was extremely disappointing for me (especially compared with Chamarel on Mauritius). Both quality & quantity was a significant step down. On top of that, their website claimed that they had a food truck present, but it was not there when I visited, so I was very hungry for lunch, and had no way to eat. I ended up leaving after spending less than an hour, drove another 20 minutes further south and got a very cheap, decent fish sandwich from a food truck in the next town. After that, it was barely 2pm, so I decided to basically drive/explore the south/southwest side of the island. There are a lot of tiny towns down there, with completely empty, pristine beaches, and virtually no tourists around. Also some kinda creepy abandoned stuff in the forest (a car was sitting blocking an over grown road, with its door open, and seemingly no humans anywhere). Saw some nice scenery, and had a slow, relaxing afternoon before driving back. That evening I had a truly spectacular dinner in Beau Vallon at the Beach House. It was a buffet (which are often not great elsewhere), but it was all local creole food, so lots of fresh fish, curries, and bold flavors. * Madagascar: likely the best known of the islands that I visited. I spent 5 days/4 nights. My primary motivation for going was for a friend's two day wedding (he married a Malagasy woman, and the first day was the traditional vodiondry ceremony, 2nd was the church wedding with huge, blow out reception and tons of guests). As I was short on time, I unfortunately, didn't get to explore the country anywhere near as much as I would have preferred. * The first day was flying there from Seychelles, and arriving very late afternoon, and then spending 90 minutes to drive to my hotel from the airport in some truly horrific traffic (which is sadly the norm). * Second day was a city tour of the capitol, Antananarivo. The tour was fine, and included the Queen's Palace (about an hour's drive north of the city) and the tourist trap craft market. * 3rd & 4th days were for the wedding. * 5th day was a very long (yet amazing) guided trip to see lemurs in the wild. We had a driver pick us up from the hotel at 5AM for the 4 hour drive east to Andasibe-Mantadia National Park. This is basically the closest place to the capitol where you can see lemurs in the wild (not a zoo). The drive was not bad, roads were in ok condition (far better than what I've read they're like in much of the rest of the country), although very twisty & mountainous, and we got to the park just before 9AM. We were assigned a guide for the park, and spent the next 3 hours hiking through the dense rain forest looking for wild life (primarily lemurs). And lemurs we did find, over a dozen total. Lemurs spend most of their lives up in the trees, so we were literally spending a lot of our time with our necks bent at an unnatural angle, looking up into the trees. We also saw geckos, and several chameleons too. The weather wasn't great, starting off cloudy, and gradually turning into a stead rain, which created a lot of mud on the trails. After lunch, we drove to the nearby Vakona Forest Lodge, which operates its own private lemur park (which in fairness is basically a zoo). They claimed that most of their lemurs were rescues (pets, etc), but they keep them from escaping by putting them on a man made island (lemurs hate water, so they aren't going to swim to freedom). These lemurs were being baited with fruit to come down to within ~2m of visitors. Sure, nice that we saw them very close, but not so great that they aren't wild, and are imprisoned on an island. The lodge also had a very cringey croc farm, with cages of birds, turtles and several chameleons. After all of that, it was mid-afternoon, and time for the (long) drive back to the capitol. At this point, there was a steady rain, and the drive back was not fun. Our driver was very professional, drove safely, but the road was congested with huge trucks, so it was a slog. Definitely worth it to see the wildlife though. What went well? Basically everything, other than the dead car battery that morning on Reunion. Would I return to these places again? Mauritius, hard no. There's simply not much for my own interests there. Seychelles, would be nice to explore the other islands, as they are each supposed to be unique/different. Reunion, maybe, there's plenty of other hiking opportunities. Madagascar, definitely, as I saw very little of the country, and there's definitely plenty more to experience there. Logistics: this was *not* a cheap trip by any means. I'm generally not a budget traveller anyway (although also not luxury). But all of the flights definitely added up, and on top of that Mauritius & Seychelles are fairly expensive destinations (since most people are going for fancy beach holidays). Madagascar can be done on a tighter budget, but my time constraints made it cost much more, as I paid for a private driver to ensure that I could go/do/see what I wanted in my very limited time. Reunion is a great hub for visiting all the other islands (it literally has direct flights to all of them). I ended up hopping from one island to the next, such that I didn't need to return to Reunion, but I could have done it that way too for more flexibility on airline flight schedules. There's just one flight/day between Mauritius & Seychelles (and it only operates 4 days/week), so that ended up determining how many days I spent on both of those islands. I flew Air France from Paris to Reunion, Air Mauritius from Reunion to Mauritius, Air Seychelles from Mauritius to Seychelles, Emirates from Seychelles to Madagascar (they have a flight from Dubai to Seychelles, which stops for a few hours before continuing to Madagascar), and then Air France again from Madagascar to Paris. Its also a very long distance from Europe (or, worse, North America) to this part of the world (11 hours flying from Paris to really any of these islands). I did mention that I got a pretty amazing hotel deal in Mauritius, so that was sort of a bargain (US$150/night including breakfast & dinner for a 4 star hotel). I stayed in a fairly small guesthouse near the volcano & waterfall hikes on Reunion which cost about US$80/night (but did *not* include breakfast). I splurged on Seychelles using hotel points, so ended up staying at a five star hotel which would have cost $$$$ otherwise, although it did include a spectacular breakfast buffet). I rented a car everywhere except Madagascar, and car rents were not cheap, but also not insanely expensive based on your typical average rental car prices from well known international companies. As noted above, both Mauritius & Seychelles have left side driving, which I've done in many other parts of the world before, so it was honestly no big deal for me. Food on Reunion was a bit more expensive than what I've found to be typical in \"main land\" France, but not excessively so. I ate lunches in restaurants on Mauritius, where it was pretty damn expensive, but these were places mainly catering to tourists. Food on Seychelles was honestly on the cheaper side overall, and was really good (although I also made an effort to read reviews to find good places).

{"id": "7782ed3210166c1ed6a6015bb0d2dbd0", "prompt": "Trip Report - Skopje to Lyon and back, by bus and train, in ~1 month", "response": "**About Me** - mid-30s male on summer break from a teaching job. I spent the first half of the summer traveling internationally before coming back to the US. **About the Trip/Disclaimer** - this was \"part 2\" of my first trip around the world, after 3.5 weeks in South Korea that I posted about [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1lv3y0j/trip_report_35_weeks_in_south_korea/). My original plan for this \"leg\" of the trip was the MUCH MORE REASONABLE idea of visiting two or three Balkan countries, but I was invited to an event in Lyon that I really wanted to attend. Normally I'm more of a ✨slow traveler✨, but I thought, \"what the hell, it'll be fun to try and cover so much distance by land.\" Even so, I know this itinerary is a bit bonkers in places lol so that's the disclaimer. **Itinerary** **Skopje (2 days)** - I'd heard kind of mixed reviews on Skopje before visiting, but I found it to be an interesting, fun, eclectic city, very affordable, some great food, and slightly \"gritty\" but not in a bad or uncomfortable way. Not hard to find local restaurants with live folk music oriented towards what seemed to be a mostly local audience, which was great. Also went in without really realizing how much of a Muslim community there is in Skopje, and it was really cool to hear so many calls-to-prayer, something I'd not heard in European cities before. **Lake Ohrid (2 days)** - because my original plan had been a \"Balkans trip,\" I did want to spend a bit more time lingering in North Macedonia before heading off. Parts of Ohrid's old town felt slightly tourist trap-y but I didn't have to walk too far to get away from that, and it was a nice relaxing place. And the bus ride from Skopje to Ohrid and back was a nice way to see more of the scenery in the country **Skopje (with daytrip: hiking near Tetovo) (2 days)** From Skopje, I took a bus to Tetovo for the day. Tetovo itself didn't strike me as super interesting, though its \"colorful mosque\" was pretty. BUT the hiking nearby was gorgeous. I just picked a few random nearby mountain villages to walk to, and it ended up being a truly beautiful day, and one of the highlights of the whole summer. Some lovely farmland in the mountains, the villages themselves were gorgeous, and the mountain scenery was also beautiful. It was an absolute whopper of a hike, little over 14 miles, by far the longest distance I've hiked in a day. Partly for the kinda dumb reason that near the end I just walked for a while until a cab came by to take me back to the Tetovo bus station. **Skopje to Ljubljana via Belgrade** I originally wanted to take several days in Bosnia + Herzegovina en route to Slovenia, but I was having a hell of a difficult time finding public transit links to Sarajevo from Skopje. Maybe there are routes that I just couldn't figure out? Anyway, by contrast, it was easy to find Flixbus bus tickets to Belgrade, but I wasn't all that hyped about Belgrade. So I made the questionable choice of (1) early AM bus departing from Skopje to Belgrade, and then (2) another bus leaving that same night and running overnight from Belgrade to Ljubljana. Kinda stupidly this meant 7 hours on a bus from Skopje to Belgrade, about nine hours in Belgrade, and then another 7 hours of overnight bus ride from Belgrade to Ljubljana. This added up to...really a lot of time on buses, and one of the more grueling public transit days of the trip. IDK, it was kind of an adventure at the same time. Bus #1 from Skopje to Belgrade gave me a chance to see some Serbian towns in passing. In Belgrade I went to a random free classical music concert, which turned out to be a performance by some child prodigies, slightly odd but kinda fun. And I visited Belgrade fortress before going back to the bus station for bus #2. I managed to get some sleep for the second overnight bus from there to Ljubljana, but was fucking wiped out the next day. Worth it? IDK, maybe I could've done this part in a smarter/less masochistic way. But I'm glad to have spent more time in North Macedonia even if it meant rushing through Serbia afterwards **Ljubljana with day trip to Postojna (two days)** - I liked Ljubljana despite being pretty tired after powering through those back-to-back bus rides. Ljubljana was a cute, peaceful, walkable, approachable little city, kinda touristy but not in a depressing way. The day trip to Postojna cave was really cool even if very crowded, and the nearby cliffside castle was also beautiful if a bit logistically odd to get to without a car. **Milan (one day)** - I'd previously been to Italy for a month-long trip (and a more reasonably paced one than this lol), so this time I was just using Milan as a one-night stopover en route to Lyon. Milan honestly isn't my favorite place in Italy but I enjoyed having some Italian food again, and had more time to wander around compared to last time I passed through Milan. Last time I was in Milan was also in February 2020, right around the time that northern Italy's covid outbreak started, so I enjoyed passing through Italy in a less grim time. **Lyon (three days)** - this part of the trip was mostly non-solo, but I did do a bit of \"tourist stuff\" on my own including a nice walk through the old town and up to the hilltop cathedral. I took a \"rest day\" here as well given the pace I'd been moving at. I liked Lyon, it felt pretty down-to-earth and I'm a sucker for a place with a nice river running through a city. **Malbun, Liechtenstein (3 days)** - due to some screwups on my end and some public transit delays as well, getting here from Lyon was a bit of a mess, but once I arrived, I *loved* it here. And taking trains across Switzerland was a nice callback to my first-ever substantial international trip, which was a non-solo trip to Switzerland. Anyway, I loved Malbun in Liechtenstein! It's a small village up in the mountains, superb base for insanely beautiful hiking, and a lovely place to relax and read and unwind. Aside from the painfully expensive cost of food here, this was another highlight of the trip, and the hike I did in this area is one of the most beautiful experiences I've had when traveling, anywhere. **Hall-in-Tirol, Austria (three days)** - a kinda chill small town close to Innsbruck but a bit smaller and more relaxed. I did a bit more (short) hiking around here, enjoyed some food and sampled some Austrian schnapps with a drunk Austrian old lady, and took the \"top of Innsbruck\" cablecar for a kind of expensive but still cool look at the town (and the mountains) from above. It was refreshingly pretty easy to get here from Liechtenstein, and not as expensive an area as I was worried, at least compared to Liechtenstein. **Zagreb, Croatia (one day)** - I had non-solo plans to meet a loved one for a week in coastal Croatia, so I started making my way there. I took my first ever sleeper train from Innsbruck to Zagreb. I spent the extra money for a private car on the sleeper train and the novelty of it was fun even if the rocking of the train meant I didn't actually sleep that much. Still, the sleeper train felt pretty luxurious compared to the overnight bus from earlier on this same trip. Zagreb was sweltering on the day I was there, and more of a stopover destination for this trip, and other than a bit of wandering around I mostly took it easy here and rested. **Trogir, Croatia (one day)** - this town has a really beautiful if sometimes crowded old town, and is a nice place to relax and chill by the water. Sunset was gorgeous here and it was one of the last solo days of the trip so I enjoyed that. **Dubrovnik, Korcula, and Cavtat, Croatia (~1 week)** - this part was non-solo so I'll mostly skip it. But, after weeks of traveling on my own, it was great to spend some time with someone I've traveled with many times before, share some travel stories, and relax in some beautiful places. Nice to do some swimming and/or wading on the hot days too. **Dubrovnik to Skopje via Pristina** - this was another of my craziest transit days. It took me kind of a lot of time to figure out a reasonable way to get back to Skopje for my flight out, and this was the best I could come up with overland. The first bus was a long overnight ride from Dubrovnik to Pristina, Kosovo. I didn't sleep a whole lot but I enjoyed chatting with this ethnically Albanian guy from Kosovo who, among other things spoke about Bill Clinton's support for Kosovo in the 1990s. He handed out some snacks and drinks both to me and surrounding folks on the bus which was friendly of him. The bus passed through Montenegro by night, Albania mostly by night, and crossed from Albania into Kosovo by day. When not half-asleep, I enjoyed seeing more of the mountainous scenery, and enjoyed a very quick look at Pristina before catching bus #2 back to Skopje **Skopje to home, via layover in Frankfurt** - I didn't have a ton of time in Skopje again, but enjoyed a (small) breakfast for 2 Euros, a far cry from prices elsewhere on this trip. And had some Turkish coffee as well, before catching a cab to the airport. I had an overnight layover in Frankfurt, and stayed in a hotel near there, but didn't really explore Frankfurt much. But I did realize at this point that I'd been in, or at least passed through, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo, N Macedonia, and Germany in ~48 hours, which by some measures at least on paper is one of the craziest things I've done on a trip **What went well** I saw a lot of beautiful places. North Macedonia was an interesting place which, at least in some areas, seemed mostly pretty distant from international mass tourism, and I'm really glad to have lingered there for a while. Liechtenstein hiking was another major highlight, and in general, I'm happy to have pushed more into hiking during my travels this year. The balance of solo time and time meeting with some friends/family was also nice especially on a longterm trip. I'm normally not inclined to move at this fast a pace, but I did still enjoy some really restful days. Even some of the long bus rides were kinda peaceful, I'd just read books or zone out and enjoy the scenery. Considering the distance covered, it felt doable, but it required some stubbornness and a bit of masochism. On the immediately preceding trip in South Korea I'd been ruminating a bit, on some days, about a painful social situation back home in Atlanta. Towards the end of this time in Europe, I surprised myself by choosing to pull the plug on that social connection completely, and it led to a brief and painful text conversation, but a lot of relief afterwards, because the dynamic there had been confusing and weird and ultimately not great. I probably wouldn't have made that choice without all this time on my own to think. Looking back on that whole situation, I think I've learned quite a bit from it. The other person could've communicated a lot better but I also could have done some things better, both for the sake of my own peace, and in terms of communication with the other person. IDK, it's nice to feel like I actually learned something from all that, and again I think the time alone helped a lot. I enjoy trying different types of alcoholic spirits (within reason) and the Balkans in particular love their fruit brandies, so sampling some of those added some extra liveliness in the evenings sometimes. Though normally I wouldn't cross so many countries back-to-back, the \"cross section\" of so many different parts of Europe all in one trip was really cool, and just seeing the contrast in culture and \"vibe\" between all these different areas was really rewarding. **What didn't go well** A few of the longest public transit days were pretty grueling. Especially the Lyon to Liechtenstein day: I missed the first train by like 5 fucking minutes, then the next train was substantially delayed, so I got to Liechtenstein much later than expected, and once I arrived I realized I hadn't brought the right kind of power adapter for Liechtenstein. These little things can pile up and feel demoralizing when on your own so that day in particular just sucked. There was a pretty intense heat wave coming through Europe for parts of this trip, which didn't necessarily ruin things, but it did mean I spent less time outdoors in some areas. With more time I could've done this same itinerary and just taken more time to chill out along the way. I had a concrete commitment back in the US that constrained the timing a bit, and made the trip more intense than it would've been otherwise. **Safety** Never really felt any danger of robbery or scams or whatever. But one thing did happen that actually could've had pretty serious consequences: I hike a lot, but it's been a long time since I've hiked in a place where tick-borne illness is a major concern. Because of this, I honestly just didn't think to research it, but I ended up getting a tick bite in a VERY UNFORTUNATE PLACE while hiking in Austria. Austrian ticks have decently high rates of tickborne encephalitis, a disease I'd never even heard of because it hasn't really reached the US. Tourists hiking in Austria are advised to get vaccinated for that disease, but I wasn't vaccinated since I hadn't even thought to research this. The tick bite was ~2 weeks ago, and I still have no symptoms, which means I'm *hopefully* not gonna get any disease, but I feel kinda dumb and tbh a bit irresponsible for not even thinking about this in advance...so this is your PSA: if hiking in Europe, do your research about tick safety in the countries you're visiting!!!! One other more minor hiking note: if planning to hike in Liechtenstein as I did, and especially if wanting to do routes higher in the mountains, I'd advise not jumping into it unless if you're a reasonably experienced/sure-footed hiker. The only other safety \"incident\" was when my cab driver in Milan almost got into a road-rage brawl with a cyclist :| they actually did exchange a few blows through the open window and the cyclist was trying to pull the driver-side door open. I guess direct risk to me was low, but it was still something I've never experienced before. Never had anything like that happen on my prior trip to Italy, probably the sort of thing that could happen anywhere with some bad luck. **Logistical stuff** Some of the buses especially in North Macedonia varied in comfort level and amenities at least by European standards. One of the local \"buses\" was more a sort of cramped van, and even some of the long-distance international buses in the Balkans didn't have bathrooms, though they made bathroom stops at least (Serbian bus stop bathrooms win the prize for grossest I've seen in Europe) Also, even with fully prepaid bus tickets, in North Macedonia and iirc Serbia, I had to pay a small extra fee to print an extra \"ticket\" just for access to the bus-boarding area. Kinda weird? Flixbus, Omio, and Girafa Travel were the websites where I found and/or booked most of the international bus and train routes. The normally reliable Rome2Rio didn't always line up with the bus routes that are currently running, at least for a few legs of this trip. In North Macedonia, I booked a cab that barely worked. The cab driver had me literally get out and push to get the cab started. Not a huge issue, but it was funny and honestly kind of amazing. Ultimately, covering this much distance by land was a fun \"adventure\" even if it was honestly a bit grueling at times. I'm glad to have done it and felt legitimately proud when I got back to Skopje at the end. That being said, I think next year I'll spend the summer in two or three countries instead of ten.", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

Any advice or tips are warmly welcomed :) Im in a very early stages of planning my 3 months trip from New Zealand to Europe. Im a first time solo traveller and Im a 54yo female. Im not leaving until next year, so likely 12 months away. Im not booking or paying for any flight/s or accomodation at the moment. I guess its in the concept stage, or slightly passed that stage. Im not backpacking, nor staying in hostels or dorms. Im planning to stay in cheap 2-3 star hotel single rooms for example ibis budget hotels around the mark of NZD$125 (EUR$65) maximum per night on average or (NZD$875 (EUR$455) maximum per week on average. Im planning on doing 25% housesitting/petsitting too as a backup but only if it's where I want to visit. I suspect these types of 2-3 star budget hotel rooms wont have a kitchenette or small fridge or anything like that. If the place has a communal kitchen then I will use the microwave to reheat a meal Ive bought from outside. If no microwave then I will just have an early dinner while its still hot (hot meal) at end of day whilst out and about. Im planing on 1 country per month. 3 months = 3 countries. Im thinking Spain, Portugal and Italy. Pick 4 cities/towns per country. 1 week per city/town. Approx. 12 cities/towns in approx. 13 weeks. Ive got NZD$25,000 (EUR$13,000) **excluding** return flight from NZ to Europe (maybe land in Madrid?) to spend towards accomodation (13 weeks x NZD$875 per week = NZD$11,375 (EUR$5,845)). NZD$25,000 - NZD$11,375 = NZD$13,625 or EUR$13,000 - EUR$5,845 = EUR$7,155. NZD$13.625 (EUR$7,155) / 13 weeks = NZD$1,048 (EUR$550) per week for a) food, b) other groceries for example shampoo, body wash, sunscreen etc, c) train/bus/cheap flight travel and d) attractions. Im not interested in restaurants and I dont drink alcohol at all, so bars, pubs, clubs, dance parties etc are of no interest either. Im happy with a local bakery, cheap cafe, street food, takeaway or something from the supermarket like a couple of yoghurts, banana and some nuts for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The rooms likely wont have a bar fridge but I can still do a quick supermarket shop every 2 days and buy food that doesnt need refrigeration, such as: just-add-hot-water cappuccinos/hot chocolates sachets, cup-a-soup sachets, small long life oat/almond milk (I know they can last 2 days with fridge if its not too hot weather wise) nuts, scroggin, crackers, biscuits, breakfast cereal, dark chocolate, fresh fruit, crisps/chips, already prepared long life protein drinks, bread, soft cheese, even a can of something like tuna or beans and I can buy a very cheap can opener. Ive had weight loss surgery a while ago and have a small stomach now, so I cant and dont eat huge amounts anyway. 2 small yoghurts and a small banana and Im FULL. I will just drink normal tap water from the hotel. Full my 1 litre (1L) soft plastic flat collapsable water bottle up every morning before I head out for the day. My plane underseat bag (aka personal items bag) is a small backpack so every morning my water bottle, snacks, sunscreen, hat, multi purpose scarf/blanket/towel thing, prescription sunglasses, mobile, charging cable and plug, pocket raincoat, umbrella, passport, pay card, bit a local currency etc will go in and off I go. So out of the above funds, there is NZD$1,048 (EUR$550) per week left. Im thinking NZD$273 (EUR$140) per week on food and other groceries. Is that realistic? At the moment, in NZ, I spend NZD$105 per week on all food and other groceries per week and I cook and eat at home every meal and every day. I spend NZD$25 per week on outside food for example 1 x cafe lunch per week or 1 x takeaway per week or coffee and snack. Total is NZD$130 per week and thats is heaps of good quality food. Surely double that, that is, NZD$273 (EUR$140) per week is enough? If yes, then that will leave me with NZD$775 (EUR$410) per week for train/bus/cheap flight travel and attractions. Is that realistic? I have NO idea whatsoever how much trains or buses cost in Spain, Portugal and Italy. Ive heard it's not cheap. Would EUR$140 per week be adequate? Over the past 6 months Ive been buying a few things.....1) ultralight Samsonite Lite Shock Sport hard shell 55 x 40 x 20 cm cabin bag that fits within the cheap airlines like ezyJet and Ryanair etc dimension rules, 2) ultralight Ecohub Ryanair soft shell underseat (aka personal items bag) backpack 40 x 25 x 20cm that also fits within the cheap airlines like ezyJet and Ryanair etc dimension rules, 3) ultralight Platypus soft plastic flat collapsible water bottle, 4) Avantree relay for onboard planes so I can use my own noise cancelling bluetooth headphones, 5) ultralight Doppler Zero99 umbrella, 6) ultralight NNormal Kjerag trail shoes, 7) ultralight compression packing cubes, 8) camping knife (very short blade, and not sharp), fork and spoon I have some other things on my radar to buy gradually: 1. pocket raincoat 2. noise cancelling bluetooth headphones 3. 2 meters long x 1 meter wide (but doubled up) very thin waffled 100% linen 'bag' that Im just going to quickly run up on my sewing machine (**multi purpose item**: large bulky wrap around scarf or long dangly scarf or blanket for onboard planes or bed bag 2m x 1m (like a simple rectangular sleeping bag liner but for a single person in a normal bed) for any suspect sheets until I can wash them or get clean ones (which Im not anticipating) or towel or beach blanket 4. approximately. 300ml portable dual voltage stainless steel kettle for having a tea, coffee, hot chocolate or cup-a-soups in my room (I suspect most cheap single rooms in Europe dont have kitchenette's in rooms) 5. small portable handheld digital usb rechargeable luggage scales 6. small portable handheld and with a stand usb rechargeable and battery fan 7. 4 meter (4m) long USB A ---> USB C cable 8.

I'll be heading off on a solo trip starting mid-August and planning to travel for about 8 months with a need to be back in Europe by March. Budget-wise, I’ve got around £8,000 set aside for this trip (with an extra £1.5K kept aside for emergencies). I'd like to keep my net-spend \\~£8K, beyond this, doing some work to get income on the side. If anyone has tips or suggestions for how much I should carry (cash vs card etc), I'd appreciate it.

Malaysia - 8 days 11. The Philippines 12. \\*Australia (?) 13. \\*New Zealand (?) Main questions: * For Mongolia, I plan to ride across part of the country (solo) on a bike. I don’t have a motorbike licence or IDP, which is making me second guess things. A friend of mine did this last year without either, but he’s also got that rich-kid “it’ll be fine” attitude that is making me, a not so rich-kid, a bit nervous. Has anyone here done this or have experience/advice on how strictly things are enforced? (If this kind of question is against the rules, let me know and I’ll edit it out – or feel free to DM me). * I'm willing to delay my trip to Turkey if it's better to get my licence - I think it probably is. * Time-wise, I’ve seen people say the bike trip in Mongolia can take anywhere from 10 to 20 days, depending on how much you stop. I’d be keen on spending a few nights in a ger, taking in the landscapes etc. If anyone’s done it, how much time would you recommend? * For Vietnam: I’m keen on cycling – are there any recommended trails or routes I should look into? Would love to explore that way if it’s viable. * For Thailand, this is likely the place whereby I would do the work - I'm thinking Preply etc. I have looked into this and it is a legally gray area but somewhat accepted - I would be prepared to take a Digitsl Nomad visa also if I was to cut Australia from the trip. * \\*Given the budget restrictions, I am considering cutting New Zealand and Australia as it'll be expensive heading to different regions and the Living Standard is more costly (yes I'm aware Japan is also expensive) but also the cost of the return flight will be significantly higher. Open to any tips, route suggestions, traveller hot spots or “wish I’d known before I went” kind of advice!

We met on hinge and after an hour or two went back to his place and had great sex. He was so kind and respectful, and we parted ways as he got up for work the next morning. Maybe it was because he was so kind that I feel this pull towards him, or because I don't have any sex life at home to go back to (living with my parents in the countryside). Either way, I find it sad that you can be so intimate with someone and just say goodbye forever. I'm not saying I want him to be my boyfriend. There's no point.

I'm trying to come up with an itinerary that utilizes my funds in a fairly efficient way - for example I thought maybe taking the train to a few major cities in several countries in a sort of loop might be good instead of flying. (Yes I realize training the whole route won't be possible) Though I would lose a potentially significant chunk of time to travel instead of actually being in the places I'm going to, but also a scenic train ride is never a bad thing.

Often inviting each other to visit the other's home country if it ever happens to be of interest.

The reason this comes up is because I am currently planning on working remotely from Germany for a month and am trying to decide which city to stay in for the trip. This trip isn't a typical hostel hopping vacation, and will instead be an extended stay, where I can work but also enjoy the country in a slower pace. I know that my enjoyment will depend on what social circle I can form / join, and that having a friend in one of these places would help introduce me to an existing group and feel more settled. I've met plenty of Germans in my travels, having collected their instagrams or whatsapps, but these often don't contain city information. Sure I could go and message each of them individually and ask, but without a good way to store / visualize it, I feel like I would be combing through DMs again if my trip happened to get pushed back or if I wanted visit a different part of Germany in the future.

{"id": "24f2c63358c020eb738ca9df898b0d9c", "prompt": "Losing excitement for travel with London experience, rethinking study abroad", "response": "I have been in London for the past month for an internship, and while it has been a really cool opportunity I am extremely grateful to have gotten, the first week especially combined with other seemingly regular challenges has kinda beaten down the innate desire for novelty, traveling, adventure, and meeting people I thought was so core to me. This is the part that is especially concerning because it feels like these are the qualities that have really defined me in recent years, and instead of being a fuel, travel has seemed to only dispirit them. I traveled with a friend to Ireland a few months ago for spring break and absolutely loved every second of it-we stayed in hostels, interacted with a lot of locals, chatted with lots of cool people, had a super packed itinerary and felt tired but always mentally energetic from all we did during the day. As someone who always itched to travel because my family was not able to do a ton of it growing up and would say is drawn to new experiences (esp ones that foster growth) and conversations with new people, this was what made me super excited to get to live in London for 2 months. Fast forward to London-my first day, I arrive at my hostel (aimed at those staying weeks/months) and it was BOILING hot with a ton of flies circulating inside. I had a few unfriendly/cold interactions with roommates, who clearly did not want to introduce themselves or extend a basic initial greeting. The first 2 weeks felt like a battle to do anything all day- I would wake up drenched in sweat after barely being able to sleep due to the heat, wake up to flies in the room again and be in the vicinity of roommates I did not feel amicable or comfortable with. I go to the bathroom-extremely hot again, weak toilet water pressure meant that nothing would flush, trash never had room to put anything in, would have to hike up 8 flights of stairs anytime I needed to go up to my room. Then this weird 45 year old man at the hostel would try to hit on me, and I saw him almost everyday in the kitchen/entrance area. So I was having a horrible time initially-I genuinely don't think I had a minute during the day I didn't feel miserable (or night, since it was a literal sauna). I thought that it was mostly the hostel, but London honestly disappointed me as well just as I started traveling. The heat in the tube was also unbearable, so many places I went to would feel quite tourist trappy and consumerist without much authentic charm, food was so expensive but often not great compared to what I had in US cities, for example. What I had loved most-meeting and having conversations with people-became something I avoided because of the many unfavorable interactions I initially had, and it started to feel as if I was having the exact same conversations over and over again. There were some fun experiences and things I'd liked about London as well, but I think I felt so constantly drained and overwhelmed that doing anything just became a chore that I didn't even feel excited for or honestly really happy or fulfilled after. I feel like I need to optimize my time abroad and take advantage of experiencing everything as much as possible, especially as this has been something I've always wanted to do. But I can't help but feel somewhat ashamed that I haven't been enjoying it as much as I thought, especially as I was given this unique opportunity. I am supposed to go to Taipei, Taiwan to study abroad in about a month for next semester, but I honestly am rethinking it. Having to readjust again and thinking of everything I had to deal in the past month in London with is making me question whether I would really even enjoy the experience at this point.", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

{"id": "0fd25fabe78bb2225f78e5f993c344cc", "prompt": "[Trip Report] - Havana, Cuba July 2025 (Solo F US Citizen)", "response": "I recently returned from Cuba and wanted to share my experience as a female solo Asian traveler. I know Cuba isn’t exactly at the top of most people’s travel lists right now, but if you’re curious, planning, or on the fence, hopefully this helps. **Cuba Requirements**: Yes, U.S. citizens can legally travel to Cuba under the “Support for the Cuban People” category. All this means avoiding government run resorts/businesses and instead staying in **casa particulares** (booked through Airbnb) and dining at **paladares** (privately-owned restaurants). I flew with Delta and to board, you need your passport and D' Viajeros form. In order to complete the form, I needed to purchase an evisa. ***There was no longer a pink tourist Visa requirement when I went and has been replaced with the evisa***. I purchased my eVisa through [*novelacuba.com*](http://novelacuba.com) (skip the pricier airline options and save yourself $50), then completed the **D’Viajeros** form using this generated visa number. I recommend printing your forms out in case you can't access it from your phone. Cuban immigration was smooth and unproblematic, even with my U.S. passport. **Prior to Going**: Downloaded GigSky for an eSIM (worked \\~80% of the time), La Nave (Cuba’s rideshare app), a VPN, and offline maps. I also brought an old unlocked iPhone and bought a Cuba SIM at the airport ($35) - you'll need this to have a Cuban number for La Nave. You can purchase the sim ahead of time and pick it up at Jose Marti Airport across from the baggage claim. Bring *all* your cash — U.S. cards don’t work. **What to Bring**: essentials - OTC meds, anti-nausea/diarrhea pills, **bug spray** (do not skip this — I didn’t bring it and regretted it), sunscreen, a hat, and extra chargers due to power outages. I also packed a checked suitcase of donations including pain relievers, deodorant, toothbrushes, school supplies, powdered milk, beef jerky, etc. for $35. Cuban immigration did not give me any issues or make me open it. **Money**: If you're researching and keep seeing mentions of CUC (Cuban Convertible Peso), just know it's completely obsolete since 2021. Cuba now uses only CUP (Cuban Peso), and most locals prefer USD anyway due to inflation. **NEVER** change money at the airport or government run places. You’ll get scammed with a terrible rate (it was 120 CUP/$1 when I was there). If you can't change your money right away, do not worry. People will happily take your dollars and they'll do the conversion rate for you. Again, be careful you're not getting ripped off. I exchanged $300 USD with my host at a 375 CUP rate. Keep in mind this rate can vary quite often. **Where I Stayed**: I stayed in Old Havana, right by Plaza Vieja. It was safe, quiet, and walkable. Most major attractions and restaurants were within a 10–25 minute walk. **Transportation**: Mostly walked. For longer trips to the Vedado neighborhood, I used La Nave. Drivers will call to confirm, which I didn’t understand, so I just said “¡Sí!” and hoped for the best (worked out fine lol). If you don't have La Nava, you can get a taxi easily around the city. Allways confirm price before getting in. **Food**: I’m aware food insecurity is real in Cuba, so I say this with sensitivity: I was just grateful to have had a meal and I enjoyed what I ate. My favs were ChaChaCha, La Guarida, Los Mercaderes, La Vitrola, and El Café. **Things to Do in Havana:** (with prices I remember off the top of my head) * Strawberry Free Walking Tour (tip-based) * Bellas Artes Museum (150 CUP \\~$0.40) * Classic Car Ride ($25/hr) * Capitolio Tour ($20 USD — overpriced but I liked the tour and guide) * Gran Teatro (600 CUP \\~$1.60 + tour guide tip) - a must! * Fábrica de Arte Cubano (1000 CUP \\~$2.66) — it's a nightclub at an art museum, cool scene * Floridita Bar - where they invented the daiquiris and Ernest Hemingway's favorite * Watch sunset on the Malecon or get a drink at Malecon 663 * La Zorra y el Cuervo - live jazz in a basement in Vedado **Day Trips from Havana:** * **Viñales (\\~3 hours):** Highly recommend finding people to split the cost with otherwise it can be pricy solo. We hired a driver for $150 roundtrip and split the cost between 3 people. I made the mistake of not confirming the itinerary in advance — the driver took us to a few places without much explanation, and we didn’t eat until late in the day. Still, Viñales was an absolutely stunning UNESCO World Heritage Site. This place cannot be missed! You can visit Cuban cigar farms and do horseback riding here. If I return, I’ll stay overnight. * **Varadero (\\~2.5 hours):** Cost was $80 for 3 people with a different driver. Again, poor planning led to some frustration — we were dropped at a random beach, and when we asked to visit **Saturno Cave**, the driver said it would cost extra. It started raining, so we cut the trip short. The beaches were beautiful, but the day itself felt disorganized. Important note - do not just negotiate the price of the trip but to actually make sure you have a well rounded itinerary or pay a little more for a guide. **Spending Summary:** I bought $1200 spent about **$550** total over 9 days. This included meals, transportation, entry fees, and a few scams along the way. The money I spent each day ranged from $20 to $50 depending on what I was doing. I wasn’t particularly frugal and things did add up quickly. It is by no means \"cheap\" but I was still able to spend under budget. **Safety as a Solo Female Traveler:** I used the same precautions I would anywhere else. I felt safe walking alone even at night and during the occasional blackouts. The catcalling was intense but it was not threatening. I was never followed, touched, or harassed. **Leaving Cuba:** Leaving was just as easy as arriving. U.S. immigration (I flew into Miami) only asked me if I had anything to declare. I want to add that I do have Global Entry. If you go through the immigration line, they may ask what you did in Cuba. Just say you were there under the “Support for the Cuban People” category and be prepared to tell them what you did. Keep your itinerary and receipts for five years, OFAC technically has the right to ask for proof. **Is it Ethical:** I understand the concern that visiting might mean you're supporting the regime - it’s a valid question. Before going, I spent a lot of time thinking about whether it was ethical to visit Cuba. The answer depends on your intentions. If you’re looking for a relaxing resort vacation, I’d say look elsewhere. Cuba is going through a severe economic crisis, and this trip requires awareness and flexibility I chose to stay in local homes, support independent restaurants, tip in dollars, donated school supplies, and connect with everyday Cubans. If you decide to bring donations, please do your research. Unfortunately a lot of it gets resold or caught up in bureaucracy. I recommend Cuba Libro, Jose Marti Primary School, and Corazon de Cuba to ensure it gets directly to the people. I made some care packages that had some essential items that are very expensive to Cubans and handed them out. Be careful doing this on the street because people watch and may swarm you. **Final Thoughts**: Cuba is not an easy destination and it’s not meant to be. There are power outages, fuel shortages, and visible signs of struggle everywhere. Buildings are collapsing. Trash lines the streets. Food is rationed. Salaries are $6-$20 a month. Doctors make $30-$40 a month that many have to become taxi drivers to earn more. People here didn’t ask me for money or food - they asked for painkillers, deodorant, and soap...even the clothes on my back. These are everyday items we take for granted. And yet, through all that, Cubans are some of the warmest, most resilient people I’ve ever met. They don’t want pity, they want dignity and to be understood. I'd also like to add that there is absolutely no hostility towards American tourists, I was treated the same as everyone else. They're just happy you're there. Cuba is one of the rare places where *how* you travel truly matters. Handing someone a bar of soap or tipping them $5 dollars isn’t fueling communism, it might just help them feed their family that week. People shouldn’t be starving in a country this rich in culture, talent, and beauty. Choosing to look away, to pretend Cuba doesn’t exist or that its people don’t deserve our attention - that’s privilege. It was a very life changing trip for me. I'd rate Cuba quite high on my list and would go back in a heartbeat.", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

I am a 31 yo, male, Asian American, first time solo travelling in Taipei. Decided to solo traveling for the first time after a not so great year. First got ghosted by gf of 4 years on Valentine's week for no apparent reason, then, before I was able to fully process that, grandma from Malaysia, whom I loved dearly, got stage 4 breast cancer. Went back to Malaysia to visit and decided to stay to look after her for her last 2 months of living. She passed away last month. Family decided a lengthy funerals for her. I had plenty of time to grief in between. After it was done, right before my visa expired, I decided to make a pit stop at Taipei, before heading home, to have my solo travel for the first time. Mostly to clear my mind of things but I was looking forward to it too. I picked Taipei because I have been here once before. It wasn't a long enough trip, just 3 days in Taipei. There were a lot of places we didn't visit. I thought picking here is the ideal choice, I have some familiarity, I speak some of the language and to visit some of the places I didn't get to visit last time. A place foreign enough to visit yet familiar enough so I don't overwhelmed myself. It was exciting the first 2 days. Visited Tamsui and Bali streets. Went to a night club for the first time on Friday, had a drink and danced. But that's where the feeling stopped. I felt worn out. I thought I would go again on Saturday, to a different club but stayed at the hotel early and slept instead. Today, I went to 228 Peace Park and Syntrend, couldn't find excitement anywhere. Everything feels bland. Now, I am just staying at the hotel, waiting for the time to pass and feel so worn out. I do wonder if meeting another fellow solo travelers/travel partners would help. But I don't know where to even meet them. I signed up for dating apps too hoping to maybe meet like-minded individuals, perhaps a casual date but most importantly, to meet up but so far the matches I get are either people selling services or locals just want to chat online and not meet up. The thing is I thought I could do more of this, maybe solo travelling to other countries in the future. Now, I don't know anymore. I am not sure my feeling is common among solo travelers or is it just me. I am a massive introvert by nature. I am wondering if that could also be the cause of it. Maybe solo travelling is not for me. I still have 2 days left of my trip that I have no goals for. I just want to stay in the hotel and wait for time to pass. Would be great to have some advice and maybe the off chance of forming a travel partner from here who's also in Taipei too. Sorry for the lengthy post, I just need a place to share my thoughts.", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_solotravel", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["solotravel", "reddit"]}}

I'd love to watch a cricket match if the domestic schedule allowed. At present, my plans are still a little sparse, so I'd be very interested in any recommendations anybody had which might align with my planned route.

{"id": "f7ad8acebe492b5861cd78c82e9072bb", "prompt": "A small tip for solo travelers that I found out. Bring candy or threats everywhere you go if you want to socialize.", "response": "So in February I embarked on my first solo travel trip through Vietnam, South-Korea and Thailand. Like many of you here I was excited but also struggled with the same things that every solo traveler face. Things like language barriers, managing funds, having the feeling that you should be doing something all the time. But the number one thing that always comes tops these lists is **socializing and making friends.** This is definitively a skill to be learned, and I gradually got better at approaching other travelers, but by accident I came across a little \"hack\" to break the ice and make this all a bit easier. So what I noticed is that a good portion of people traveling alone are eager to talk. They have many things to say, and want socialize too. But like you they are also a bit afraid to start the conversation. Enter my tip of the day, **candy.** So I was on a flight from Surat Thani to Chiang Mai, Thailand. I was seated in the middle seat and in the window seat was a girl around my age, It was late at night, she was watching Netflix, AirPods in, hoodie all the way over her head and we never even made eye contact or anything. I was eating candy, individually packaged (this helps a bit with trust of course) and while eating one, I offered her one without even saying a word. She paused her video and suddenly threw a smile at me and told me how nice of a gesture that was. After that it was so easy to start a convo, and at the bagage claim we talked a bit about Chiang Mai, traveling and we even exchanged Instagram profiles to meet up later on. I then thought I was on to something, so the next days I went to 7-11, bought some Chupa Chups lollypops and kept them in my day pack to carry around. Often time I gave them to the hostel workers, and made some really cool local friends this way. This in my achieves a couple of things: * You are offering something of 'value' for free, so you come across as friendly * Either they like candy and you just gave them a bit off happiness, or they politely decline, but then you are already in a conversation, so it is way less scary to continue asking where they are from. * It is such an easy step by step process that you can repeat every time. So maybe next time you are feeling a bit lonely and want to socialize, go spend a few Thai bath, get some packaged treats, and start offering them to people. The worst that can happen is that you get a friendly \"no thanks\" and are left with some sweet candy. Let me know if you had similar experiences or have tried this yourselves!

I have time to travel for 9 weeks in September and have always wanted to go to Patagonia! Since however September is still a bit to cold for Patagonia, my idea was to start in north of chile (at the Atacama desert) and work my way down to Chilean Patagonia. I would be solo backpacking, staying in hostels, using buses etc. However, I am having trouble finding any information on whether 2 months through chile and Patagonia is a “good” idea. Most of the itineraries that I’ve seen so far either are for 2-4 weeks in chile and patagonia OR are 2-3 months and include Easter island (which is out of my budget lol) Peru and Bolivia (Peru I’ve already done I am currently not keen on bolivia) So here are my questions: - is doing chile and Patagonia only for 9 weeks too long? Is there enough to see/explore? I’m okay with chilling and slow travel but realistically - is this time frame a bit too much? - I know it’s expensive and I’m prepared for that but is spending 9 weeks there slow traveling not really that good of an idea? Like will I be wasting money Another idea I had was to do one month in Colombia or Guatemala and then fly into Chilean Patagonia for a month, however - since I am planning to do the o trek (7-9 days) will that then mean it’s too little time for the other parts of Patagonia? - will I be majorly missing an opportunity to see chile (I.e. atacama and central chile); basically is it worth prioritizing seeing chile?

I gave a three star review to my guided tour experience. It was not a good tour as depicted above. My phone was on 10% battery (my fault) so I had powered it off and used it exclusively to show tickets to the security members. My tour guide made me power it on and tried to give himself 5 stars, wasting more battery. I was quite nervous I'd have to pay again. Within an hour, I get these handy little messages on WhatsApp. I have blurred out all identifying characteristics. This tour guide was super pushy about his rating. I gave him 3 stars because I'm not heartless but I regret doing that immensely. Let me be explicitly clear: 1. He did take me to a tourist trap where he is affiliated with the owners. They had the exact same wifi password and greeted eachother. They knew eachother. Review after review of this place said the same thing. 2. He took my phone from my hands under false pretenses. 3. He is not going to lose his job. Be realistic here. I am one tourist in a sea of thousands of others saying how good he is with their very 'real' reviews 4. I did not want him in my hotel. He can keep his money. But I was and am scared he may appear at any time. 5. This seemed like a legit tour. Mid range price, about a thousand positive reviews, on GetYourGuide, a popular and well-known site. I didn't expect any of this. I kept the conversation going because I had no idea where it was going and I'm waiting for my shuttle bus (so I'm bored). Then it turned into him saying he's coming to my hostel.

Small children run under foot and when you stop to not crash into the poor kid, seven more people surround you. I went into a shop and two sales clerks applied a lot of pressure for me to buy everything. I left empty handed because that was waaaaay too much.

I’ll be rehydrating home cooked breakfasts and dinners that I’m dehydrating beforehand. I’ve done a lot of thinking about which rehydration approach is the best choice for us and so far I’m leaning towards individual silicone bags (option #1 below) but I’m having a hard time deciding which silicone bag option would be best. Does anyone have experience rehydrating in reusable silicone bags? What has your experience been? (I’m considering stasher, filfisk, thermomix, weesprout and cadrim) My thoughts on the different silicone bags options: Stasher bags seem to be the heaviest by far, they’re also expensive and have a zip closure. filfisk, weesprout and cadrim dorm let you buy 6 bags of one size without buying 6 full sets. thermomix bags are expensive and have a weird shape that seems tough to eat from, but their closure mechanism seems ideal. My thoughts about the bigger question of how to rehydrate our meals: I want to: - eat a hot meal as a group (at the same time) - Minimize number of stoves I have to carry & operate simultaneously - Minimize clean up - Minimize weight - Minimize waste - Minimize exposure to harmful chemicals Options I’ve been considering include: 1. 1 pot and 6 reusable silicone bags - How it would work: boil water in pot, everyone rehydrates and eats in their own bag - Cons: heavier than Mylar bags, maybe tricky to clean if they have a zip closure or internal corners/folds - Pros: hassle free, no waste, no exposure to harmful chemicals 2. 1 pot and 6 Mylar bags - How it would work: boil water in pot, everyone rehydrates and eats in their own bag - Cons: leach small amounts of harmful chemicals (more so if reused), produces plastic waste (less so if reused) - Pros: hassle free, minimal weight/cleanup (depending on whether we reuse them) 3. 1 big pot and 5 bowls - How it would work: rehydrate 6 servings in pot and everyone eats from their own bowl - Cons: heavy, expensive, bulky, have to clean pot - Pros: no waste or exposure to harmful chemicals 4. 2-3 smaller pots and 4-3 bowls - How it would work: rehydrate 6 servings spread across two or three pots and everyone eats in their own bowl/pot - Cons: big hassle to operate multiple pots at the same time, heavy, bulky, have to clean multiple pots - Pros: no waste or exposure to harmful chemicals", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_backpacking", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["backpacking", "reddit"]}}

Last night, she started drinking on the street despite knowing it’s illegal here and against our advice to wait the 10 minutes until she reached home , and then initiated conversation with two drunk men who didn’t speak English. These guys seemed friendly but were also sketchy - cut-up knuckles, missing teeth, requests for arm wrestles (and calling them sexist for refusing to arm wrestle her), friendly gesturing toward fighting, the works. She thought it was harmless fun, but it easily could have escalated. When we tried to tell her to stop, she got defensive and acted like she had done nothing wrong. We’ve reminded her multiple times that this isn’t like partying in Thailand. These are conservative Muslim areas where even small missteps can be misunderstood and cause big problems, especially as we go further into more remote and culturally sensitive places. But she doesn’t seem to care or take it seriously, and I’m genuinely worried that her behaviour could endanger the whole group or at least cause major tension. The problem is I don’t want this to cause issues between me and my friend, but I don’t think we can keep ignoring this. I don’t want to be the killjoy, but I also don’t want to end up in a police station (or worse). Has anyone dealt with a similar situation while travelling? How do you get someone to understand cultural boundaries and risk? How do I approach this without it blowing up the group dynamic? Any advice would be appreciated.", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_backpacking", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["backpacking", "reddit"]}}

(ya, I know the saying 'a pound on your feet is like five on your back'… but my pack was five on my back just standing still. 😅) Looking for something lighter but not totally frameless, not necessarily ultralight, I still want comfort for multiday trips. Right now I’m torn between the Gossamer Gear Mariposa or Gorilla, the Durston Kakwa, or the ULA Circuit. Anyone have advice or pros/cons between those?

Taken from Inyo County Search & Rescue", "response": "One of the most common symptoms of rapid and severe altitude illness is a headache. While some headaches are just headaches, some of them are the early sign of major brain swelling! A surprisingly common response to poor acclimatization. HACE or high-altitude cerebral edema can happen to anyone, even folks who normally perform well at higher altitudes. Yet another very common problem at altitude is dehydration. We get dehydrated quicker because we are losing more moisture through increased breathing and urination. This is a byproduct from the body trying to adapt to altitude changes. The air is also dryer as we increase in altitude, robbing our body of yet even more moisture. Plus, cold temps will cause people to often drink less water. So, when is a headache NOT just a headache? When it will not go away. Even after you… 1. Hydrate really well. 2. Use typical remedies such as ibuprofen, caffeine, and rest without improvement. Or it comes back. If your headache really isn’t getting better with the above treatments, you need to go down. Descent is the ONLY definitive treatment to altitude illness.", "entities": {"source": "reddit_r_backpacking", "category": "general_travel", "location": "", "tags": ["backpacking", "reddit"]}}

Out there — on the road — was where life happened, full of exciting adventures, fascinating people, and endless possibilities. No dreary commutes, 30-minute lunch breaks, mind-numbing meetings, or endless lists of to-dos squeezed into a rushed weekend. Why would anyone want to be home, the place where routine seemed to sap your will to exist? It baffled me. My first trip overseas — a vacation to Costa Rica — made me fall in love with travel. For all the reasons mentioned above, I realized why “vacations” were so romanticized in work culture. There was a freedom to them that stood in stark contrast to the daily corporate grind. So, when I finally quit my job, I set off on an adventure to experience all the world had to offer for as long as I could make my money last. I mean, who could possibly tire of life on the road? Well, me. Eventually, I did tire of being a full-time nomad. I craved a stable group of friends, regular workouts, a bar that knew my name, a kitchen to cook in, and my own bed. Suddenly, I realized that “home” wasn’t a dirty word. It just felt that way to a young, restless soul for whom adulthood felt eons away. I had come to understand what someone who is just setting out with romantic notions about travel couldn’t: You can burn out. On my first trip abroad, after 18 months, I hit the wall and decided to cut my trip short. Then, years later, in 2013, I decided that being a nomad was no longer the life for me and decided to stop traveling full-time. It was time to grow up, I said. Time to stay put and move on from nomad to… whatever came next. But the allure of the road — and the business of working in travel — pulled me back constantly. As the years went by, I lived between two worlds: one in which I am traveling, longing for home, and another in which I am home, longing to head out again. There were moments where I longed fo", "entities": {"source": "travel_blog", "category": "travel_guide", "location": "", "tags": ["blog", "guide"]}}
